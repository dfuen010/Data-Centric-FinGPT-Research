Nominal is doing exactly that, specifically for electrical, mechanical, and aerospace engineers who are building next generation, humanity-propelling systems. We bring expertise in data infrastructure &amp; world-class UI design to unbelievably hard-working teams, who are often neglected by the software industry. (To be fair, due to significant technical challenges, challenges that we are excited to tackle head on!)<p>Everyone here is familiar with the stack of software-focused CI&#x2F;CD, infrastructure, application monitoring, and data pipeline technologies.  All of these are square pegs in round holes for our users, and the process of duct-taping them together in a fast-moving, multidisciplinary hardware engineering organization leads to a lot of wasted time and frustration.  A holistic platform that caters to our users&#x27; workflows will massively accelerate the important developments that we as a society need, and Nominal is excited to be a tide that lifts all boats.<p>We work on complex multi-modal data problems, building interfaces to the ever-changing landscape of data modeling, storage, and analysis technologies, and helping people determine important performance characteristics of their systems in minutes, not days (and soon, in sub-second time frames!).

Stock photos looked awkward, the color wheel became your nemesis, and your final creation resembled a ransom note assembled by a kindergartener.

And the pain only intensifies from here.<p>We all fall victim to this delusion of potential.

Perhaps you spent hours critiquing app design, deciding, \u201cHey, I could do that way better.\u201d Or maybe one too many Instagram ads convinced you logo design was a quick and easy path to a freelance fortune.<p>Any good creative cant bare to see their first works due to the cringe invoking, but whats missed here is that its some of your most important work, those cringe-worthy first works deserve attention and even a little respect:<p>They\u2019re Your Baseline: Those early pieces are your starting point, the raw, unfiltered version of your creative vision.

The difference is, they stuck with it. Why? Who knows. Maybe delusion, maybe desperation\u2026<p>The thing is, we become connoisseurs before we become creators.

It\u2019s the sudden gut-punch of scale. That perfectly minimalist website wasn\u2019t just thrown together \u2014 it\u2019s the result of wireframing, user testing, iteration upon iteration. Suddenly, crafting something that simply doesn\u2019t induce eye strain seems like a Herculean task.<p>And that\u2019s where most people give up. Honestly, can you blame them? Why torture yourself with this digital gauntlet? But if you\u2019re reading this, something in you refuses to quit just yet. Maybe it\u2019s a delusion of grandeur.

I&#x27;m not sure the consequences of removing that tool but it would be that. There&#x27;s also a concern about budget because if the development pace keeps up enough, then queue management of outstanding orders is also a problem (although that&#x27;s true today, it&#x27;s a problem for developers instead of the government). It might be interesting to have statuatory pricing for scheduling inspections for specific times (e.g. if you need it by next Monday, the price is 10 000x, if you make a reservation for an inspection in 12 months, the price is 0.5x &amp; if you reschedule there&#x27;s a meaningful penalty) &amp; having requirements that the inspection must be completed within X days of some milestone (e.g. the business being open). That way the budget problem and the development process are intertwined and self-funded without involving politics and limiting how much competitors can screw over each other.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not all or nothing. Fire inspections are not typically the issue.<p>The bigger issue though is things like electrical inspections which are blockers since they have to happen before other parts of the process complete (i.e. hard to inspect electrical when the business is open and the walls are all finished).","dead":null,"deleted":null,"kids":null}
