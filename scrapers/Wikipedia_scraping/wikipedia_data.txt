Page Title - Python (programming language)

*: History 

Python was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde Informatica CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language which was inspired by SETL capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system Its implementation began in December 1989 Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project as the lead developer until 12 July 2018 when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python s benevolent dictator for life a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project s chief decision maker In January 2019 active Python core developers elected a five member Steering Council to lead the project Python 2 0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features such as list comprehensions cycle detecting garbage collection reference counting and Unicode support Python 3 0 released on 3 December 2008 with many of its major features backported to Python 2 6 x and 2 7 x Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3 Python 2 7 s end of life was initially set for 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to Python 3 No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it Currently only 3 8 and later are supported 2023 security issues were fixed in e g 3 7 17 the final 3 7 x release While Python 2 7 and older is officially unsupported a different unofficial Python implementation PyPy continues to support Python 2 i e 2 7 18 plus 3 9 and 3 10 with the plus meaning at least some backported security updates In 2021 and again twice in 2022 security updates were expedited since all Python versions were insecure including 2 7 because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning In 2022 Python 3 10 4 and 3 9 12 were expedited and 3 8 13 because of many security issues When Python 3 9 13 was released in May 2022 it was announced that the 3 9 series joining the older series 3 8 and 3 7 would only receive security fixes in the future On 7 September 2022 four new releases were made due to a potential denial of service attack 3 10 7 3 9 14 3 8 14 and 3 7 14 As of October 2023 Python 3 12 is the stable release and 3 12 and 3 11 are the only versions with active as opposed to just security support Notable changes in 3 11 from 3 10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting Python 3 12 adds syntax and in fact every Python since at least 3 5 adds some syntax to the language the new soft keyword type recent releases have added a lot of typing support e g new type union operator in 3 10 and 3 11 for exception handling and 3 10 the match and case soft keywords for structural pattern matching statements Python 3 12 also drops outdated modules and functionality and future versions will too see below in Development section Python 3 11 claims to be between 10 and 60 faster than Python 3 10 and Python 3 12 adds another 5 on top of that It also has improved error messages and many other changes Since 27 June 2023 Python 3 8 is the oldest supported version of Python albeit in the security support phase due to Python 3 7 reaching end of life  

*: Design philosophy and features 

Python is a multi paradigm programming language Object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported and many of their features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming including metaprogramming and metaobjects Many other paradigms are supported via extensions including design by contract and logic programming Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management It uses dynamic name resolution late binding which binds method and variable names during program execution Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition It has filter mapandreduce functions list comprehensions dictionaries sets and generator expressions The standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python PEP 20 which includes aphorisms such as Beautiful is better than ugly Explicit is better than implicit Simple is better than complex Complex is better than complicated Readability counts However Python features regularly violate these principles and received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3 8 Nevertheless rather than building all of its functionality into its core Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications Van Rossum s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC which espoused the opposite approach Python claims to strive for a simpler less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology In contrast to Perl s there is more than one way to do it motto Python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it philosophy In practice however Python provides many ways to achieve the same task There are for example at least three ways to format a string literal with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use Alex Martelli a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author wrote To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python culture Python s developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity Execution speed can be improved by moving speed critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C or by using a just in time compiler like PyPy It is also possible to cross compile to other languages but it either doesn t provide the full speed up that might be expected since Python is a very dynamic language or a restricted subset of Python is compiled and possibly semantics are slightly changed Python s developers aim for it to be fun to use This is reflected in its name a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials such as the use of the terms spam and eggs a reference to a Monty Python sketch in examples instead of the often used foo and bar A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic which has a wide range of meanings related to program style Pythonic code may use Python idioms well be natural or show fluency in the language or conform with Python s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic  

*: Syntax and semantics 

Python is meant to be an easily readable language Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation Unlike many other languages it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal  

**: Indentation 

Python uses whitespace indentation rather than curly brackets or keywords to delimit blocks An increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block Thus the program s visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure This feature is sometimes termed the off side rule Some other languages use indentation this way but in most indentation has no semantic meaning The recommended indent size is four spaces  

**: Statements and control flow 

Python s statements include The assignment statement using a single equals sign The if statement which conditionally executes a block of code along with else and elif a contraction of else if The for statement which iterates over an iterable object capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block The while statement which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true The try statement which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses or new syntax except in Python 3 11 for exception groups it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits The raise statement used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception The class statement which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class for use in object oriented programming The def statement which defines a function or method The with statement which encloses a code block within a context manager for example acquiring a lock before it is run then releasing the lock or opening and closing a file allowing resource acquisition is initialization RAII like behavior and replacing a common try finally idiom The break statement which exits a loop The continue statement which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next The del statement which removes a variable deleting the reference from the name to the value and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined The pass statement serving as a NOP syntactically needed to create an empty code block The assert statement used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply The yield statement which returns a value from a generator function and also an operator used to implement coroutines The return statement used to return a value from a function The import and from statements used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current programThe assignment statement binds a name as a reference to a separate dynamically allocated object Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object In Python a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type however it always refers to some object with a type This is called dynamic typing in contrast to statically typed languages where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type Python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations and according to Van Rossum it never will However better support for coroutine like functionality is provided by extending Python s generators Before 2 5 generators were lazy iterators data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator From Python 2 5 on it is possible to pass data back into a generator function and from version 3 3 it can be passed through multiple stack levels  

**: Expressions 

Python s expressions include The and operators for mathematical addition subtraction and multiplication are similar to other languages but the behavior of division differs There are two types of divisions in Python floor division or integer division and floating point division Python uses the operator for exponentiation Python uses the operator for string concatenation Python uses the operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times The infix operator It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication The syntax called the walrus operator was introduced in Python 3 8 It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression In Python compares by value Python s is operator may be used to compare object identities comparison by reference and comparisons may be chained for example a b c Python uses and or and not as Boolean operators Python has a type of expression named a list comprehension and a more general expression named a generator expression Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions however there may be only one expression in each body Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y different in order of operands from the c x y operator common to many other languages Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples Lists are written as 1 2 3 are mutable and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in Python Tuples written as 1 2 3 are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries provided all of the tuple s elements are immutable The operator can be used to concatenate two tuples which does not directly modify their contents but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both Thus given the variable t initially equal to 1 2 3 executing t t 4 5 first evaluates t 4 5 which yields 1 2 3 4 5 which is then assigned back to t thereby effectively modifying the contents of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable writable property etc are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and as a whole are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through them it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left Python has a string format operator that functions analogously to printf format strings in C e g spam s eggs d blah 2 evaluates to spam blah eggs 2 In Python 2 6 and 3 this was supplemented by the format method of the str class e g spam 0 eggs 1 format blah 2 Python 3 6 added f strings spam blah eggs 2 f spam spam eggs eggs Strings in Python can be concatenated by adding them with the same operator as for adding integers and floats e g spam eggs returns spameggs If strings contain numbers they are added as strings rather than integers e g 2 2 returns 22 Python has various string literals Delimited by single or double quotes unlike in Unix shells Perl and Perl influenced languages single and double quotes work the same Both use the backslash as an escape character String interpolation became available in Python 3 6 as formatted string literals Triple quoted beginning and ending with three single or double quotes which may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells Perl and Ruby Raw string varieties denoted by prefixing the string literal with r Escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common such as regular expressions and Windows style paths Compare quoting in C Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists denoted as a key a start stop or a start stop step Indexes are zero based and negative indexes are relative to the end Slices take elements from the start index up to but not including the stop index The third slice parameter called step or stride allows elements to be skipped and reversed Slice indexes may be omitted for example a returns a copy of the entire list Each element of a slice is a shallow copy In Python a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp Scheme or Ruby This leads to duplicating some functionality For example List comprehensions vs for loops Conditional expressions vs if blocks The eval vs exec built in functions in Python 2 exec is a statement the former is for expressions the latter is for statementsStatements cannot be a part of an expression so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions all being expressions cannot contain statements A particular case is that an assignment statement such as a 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions if c 1 is syntactically valid but probably unintended C code but if c 1 causes a syntax error in Python  

**: Methods 

Methods on objects are functions attached to the object s class the syntax instance method argument is for normal methods and functions syntactic sugar for Class method instance argument Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data in contrast to the implicit self or this in some other object oriented programming languages e g C Java Objective C Ruby Python also provides methods often called dunder methods due to their names beginning and ending with double underscores to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length comparison in arithmetic operations and type conversion  

**: Typing 

Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names Type constraints are not checked at compile time rather operations on an object may fail signifying that it is not of a suitable type Despite being dynamically typed Python is strongly typed forbidding operations that are not well defined for example adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes most often used for object oriented programming New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example SpamClass or EggsClass and the classes are instances of the metaclass type itself an instance of itself allowing metaprogramming and reflection Before version 3 0 Python had two kinds of classes both using the same syntax old style and new style current Python versions only support the semantics new style Python supports optional type annotations These annotations are not enforced by the language but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors Mypy also supports a Python compiler called mypyc which leverages type annotations for optimization  

**: Arithmetic operations 

Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators the floor division operator and the modulo operation where the remainder can be negative e g 4 3 2 It also has for exponentiation e g 5 3 125 and 9 0 5 3 0 and a matrix multiplication operator These operators work like in traditional math with the same precedence rules the operators infix and can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively The division between integers produces floating point results The behavior of division has changed significantly over time Current Python i e since 3 0 changed to always be floating point division e g 5 2 2 5 The floor division operator was introduced So 7 3 2 7 3 3 7 5 3 2 0 and 7 5 3 3 0 Adding from future import division causes a module used in Python 2 7 to use Python 3 0 rules for division see above In Python terms is true division or simply division and is floor division before version 3 0 is classic division Rounding towards negative infinity though different from most languages adds consistency For instance it means that the equation a b b a b 1 is always true It also means that the equation b a b a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a However maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is as expected in the half open interval 0 b where b is a positive integer it has to lie in the interval b 0 when b is negative Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer For tie breaking Python 3 uses round to even round 1 5 and round 2 5 both produce 2 Versions before 3 used round away from zero round 0 5 is 1 0 round 0 5 is 1 0 Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics For example the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c C derived languages interpret this expression differently in C the expression would first evaluate a b resulting in 0 or 1 and that result would then be compared with c Python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations The Decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers Due to Python s extensive mathematics library and the third party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation  

*: Programming examples 

 Hello World program Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer  

*: Libraries 

Python s large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths For Internet facing applications many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces connecting to relational databases generating pseudorandom numbers arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals manipulating regular expressions and unit testing Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example the Web Server Gateway Interface WSGI implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333 but most are specified by their code internal documentation and test suites However because most of the standard library is cross platform Python code only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations As of 17 March 2024 the Python Package Index PyPI the official repository for third party Python software contains over 523 000 packages with a wide range of functionality including  

*: Development environments 

Most Python implementations including CPython include a read eval print loop REPL permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately Python also comes with an Integrated development environment IDE called IDLE which is more beginner oriented Other shells including IDLE and IPython add further abilities such as improved auto completion session state retention and syntax highlighting As well as standard desktop integrated development environments including PyCharm IntelliJ Idea Visual Studio Code etc there are web browser based IDEs including SageMath for developing science and math related programs PythonAnywhere a browser based IDE and hosting environment and Canopy IDE a commercial IDE emphasizing scientific computing  

*: Implementations 

 

**: Reference implementation 

CPython is the reference implementation of Python It is written in C meeting the C89 standard Python 3 11 uses C11 with several select C99 features CPython includes its own C extensions but third party extensions are not limited to older C versions e g they can be implemented with C11 or C It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python and is available for many platforms including Windows starting with Python 3 9 the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8 Windows XP was supported until Python 3 5 and most modern Unix like systems including macOS and Apple M1 Macs since Python 3 9 1 with experimental installer and unofficial support for e g VMS Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities During Python 1 and 2 development even OS 2 and Solaris were supported but support has since been dropped for many platforms  

**: Other implementations 

PyPy is a fast compliant interpreter of Python 2 7 and 3 8 Its just in time compiler often brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but some libraries written in C cannot be used with it Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads it does not use the call stack in the same way thus allowing massively concurrent programs PyPy also has a stackless version MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers including Lego Mindstorms EV3 Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs Cinder is a performance oriented fork of CPython 3 8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching eager evaluation of coroutines a method at a time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler Snek Embedded Computing Language supporting e g 8 bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P based Arduino and larger ones that are MicroPython can also support is Python inspired but it is not Python It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system but most Python programs will not run under Snek It s an imperative language not including OOP classes unlike Python and simplifying to one number type like JavaScript except using smaller 32 bit single precision Integer values of less than 24 bits can be represented exactly in these floating point values  

**: Unsupported implementations 

Other just in time Python compilers have been developed but are now unsupported Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009 with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock Psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code Psyco does not support Python 2 7 or later PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005 It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries enabling programs to be written and run on the target device  

**: Cross-compilers to other languages 

There are several compilers transpilers to high level object languages with either unrestricted Python a restricted subset of Python or a language similar to Python as the source language Brython Transcrypt and Pyjs latest release in 2012 compile Python to JavaScript Codon compiles a subset of statically typed Python to machine code via LLVM and supports native multithreading Cython compiles a superset of Python to C The resulting code is also usable with Python via direct C level API calls into the Python interpreter PyJL compiles transpiles a subset of Python to human readable maintainable and high performance Julia source code Despite claiming high performance no tool can claim to do that for arbitrary Python code i e it s known not possible to compile to a faster language or machine code Unless semantics of Python are changed but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code and based that way Nuitka compiles Python into C Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C C 11 RPython can be compiled to C and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python The Python 11l C transpiler compiles a subset of Python 3 to C C 17 Specialized MyHDL is a Python based hardware description language HDL that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code Older projects or not to be used with Python 3 x and latest syntax Google s Grumpy latest release in 2017 transpiles Python 2 to Go IronPython allows running Python 2 7 programs and an alpha released in 2021 is also available for Python 3 4 although features and behaviors from later versions may be included on the NET Common Language Runtime Jython compiles Python 2 7 to Java bytecode allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program Pyrex latest release in 2010 and Shed Skin latest release in 2013 compile to C and C respectively  

**: Performance 

Performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non numerical combinatorial workload was presented at EuroSciPy 13 Python s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game  

*: Development 

Python s development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal PEP process the primary mechanism for proposing major new features collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions Python coding style is covered in PEP 8 Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council Enhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation The mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language s development Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at by the foundation In 2022 all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub Development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running Mercurial until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017 CPython s public releases come in three types distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented Backward incompatible versions where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported The first part of the version number is incremented These releases happen infrequently version 3 0 was released 8 years after 2 0 According to Guido van Rossum a version 4 0 is very unlikely to ever happen Major or feature releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features The second part of the version number is incremented Starting with Python 3 9 these releases are expected to happen annually Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release Bugfix releases which introduce no new features occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases The third and final part of the version number is incremented Many alpha beta and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases Although there is a rough schedule for each release they are often delayed if the code is not ready Python s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development The major academic conference on Python is PyCon There are also special Python mentoring programs such as PyLadies Python 3 12 removed wstr meaning Python extensions need to be modified and 3 10 added pattern matching to the language Python 3 12 dropped some outdated modules and more will be dropped in the future deprecated as of 3 13 already deprecated array u format code will emit DeprecationWarning since 3 13 and will be removed in Python 3 16 The w format code should be used instead Part of ctypes is also deprecated and http server CGIHTTPRequestHandler will emit a DeprecationWarning and will be removed in 3 15 Using that code already has a high potential for both security and functionality bugs Parts of the typing module are deprecated e g creating a typing NamedTuple class using keyword arguments to denote the fields and such and more will be disallowed in Python 3 15  

*: API documentation generators 

Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc available as part of the standard library Sphinx Pdoc and its forks Doxygen and Graphviz among others  

*: Naming 

Python s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture for example the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines Users of Python are sometimes referred to as Pythonistas The prefix Py is used to show that something is related to Python Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame a binding of SDL to Python commonly used to create games PyQt and PyGTK which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively and PyPy a Python implementation originally written in Python  

*: Popularity 

Since 2003 Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where as of December 2022 it was the most popular language ahead of C C and Java It was selected as Programming Language of the Year for the highest rise in ratings in a year in 2007 2010 2018 and 2020 the only language to have done so four times as of 2020 Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia Google Yahoo CERN NASA Facebook Amazon Instagram Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python  

*: Uses 

Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications e g via mod wsgi for the Apache webserver With Web Server Gateway Interface a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications Web frameworks like Django Pylons Pyramid TurboGears web2py Tornado Flask Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client side of Ajax based applications SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers and is used for example by Dropbox Libraries such as NumPy SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain specific functionality SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python its library covers many aspects of mathematics including algebra combinatorics numerical mathematics number theory and calculus OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow Keras Pytorch scikit learn and the Logic language ProbLog As a scripting language with a modular architecture simple syntax and rich text processing tools Python is often used for natural language processing The combination of Python and Prolog has proved to be particularly useful for AI applications with Prolog providing knowledge representation and reasoning capablities The Janus system in particular exploits the similarites between these two languages in part because of their use of dynamic typing and the simple recursive nature of their data structures Typical applications of this combination include natural language processing visual query answering geospatial reasoning and handling of semantic web data The Natlog system implemented in Python uses Definite Clause Grammars DCGs as prompt generators for text to text generators like GPT3 and text to image generators like DALL E or Stable Diffusion Python can also be used for graphical user interface GUI by using libraries like Tkinter Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language including in finite element method software such as Abaqus 3D parametric modelers like FreeCAD 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max Blender Cinema 4D Lightwave Houdini Maya modo MotionBuilder Softimage the visual effects compositor Nuke 2D imaging programs like GIMP Inkscape Scribus and Paint Shop Pro and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C containers Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS It has also been used in several video games and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine the other two being Java and Go Many operating systems include Python as a standard component It ships with most Linux distributions AmigaOS 4 using Python 2 7 FreeBSD as a package NetBSD and OpenBSD as a package and can be used from the command line terminal Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system Portage Python is used extensively in the information security industry including in exploit development Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO developed at Sugar Labs as of 2008 is written in Python The Raspberry Pi single board computer project has adopted Python as its main user programming language LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4 0 from 7 February 2013  

*: Languages influenced by Python 

Python s design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages Boo uses indentation a similar syntax and a similar object model Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax and its Acknowledgements document lists Python first among languages that influenced it CoffeeScript a programming language that cross compiles to JavaScript has Python inspired syntax ECMAScript JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python GDScript a scripting language very similar to Python built in to the Godot game engine Go is designed for the speed of working in a dynamic language like Python and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java Julia was designed to be as usable for general programming as Python Mojo is a non strict superset of Python e g still missing classes and adding e g struct Nim uses indentation and similar syntax Ruby s creator Yukihiro Matsumoto has said I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl and more object oriented than Python That s why I decided to design my own language Swift a programming language developed by Apple has some Python inspired syntax Python s development practices have also been emulated by other languages For example the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for and issues surrounding a change to the language in Python a PEP is also used in Tcl Erlang and Swift

Page Title - Heterosexuality

*: Terminology 

Hetero comes from the Greek word h teros meaning other party or another used in science as a prefix meaning different and the Latin word for sex that is characteristic sex or sexual differentiation The current use of the term heterosexual has its roots in the broader 19th century tradition of personality taxonomy The term heterosexual was coined alongside the word homosexual by Karl Maria Kertbeny in 1869 The terms were not in current use during the late nineteenth century but were reintroduced by Richard von Krafft Ebing and Albert Moll around 1890 The noun came into wider use from the early 1920s but did not enter common use until the 1960s The colloquial shortening hetero is attested from 1933 The abstract noun heterosexuality is first recorded in 1900 The word heterosexual was listed in Merriam Webster s New International Dictionary in 1923 as a medical term for morbid sexual passion for one of the opposite sex however in 1934 in their Second Edition Unabridged it is defined as a manifestation of sexual passion for one of the opposite sex normal sexuality Hyponyms of heterosexual include heteroflexible The word can be informally shortened to hetero The term straight originated as a mid 20th century gay slang term for heterosexuals ultimately coming from the phrase to go straight as in straight and narrow or stop engaging in homosexual sex One of the first uses of the word in this way was in 1941 by author G W Henry Henry s book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with people who are identified as ex gays It is now simply a colloquial term for heterosexual having changed in primary meaning over time Some object to usage of the term straight because it implies that non heterosexual people are crooked  

*: Demographics 

In their 2016 literature review Bailey et al stated that they expect that in all cultures the vast majority of individuals are sexually predisposed exclusively to the other sex i e heterosexual and that there is no persuasive evidence that the demographics of sexual orientation have varied much across time or place Heterosexual activity between only one male and one female is by far the most common type of sociosexual activity According to several major studies 89 to 98 of people have had only heterosexual contact within their lifetime but this percentage falls to 79 84 when either or both same sex attraction and behavior are reported A 1992 study reported that 93 9 of males in Britain have only had heterosexual experience while in France the number was reported at 95 9 According to a 2008 poll 85 of Britons have only opposite sex sexual contact while 94 of Britons identify themselves as heterosexual Similarly a survey by the UK Office for National Statistics ONS in 2010 found that 95 of Britons identified as heterosexual 1 5 of Britons identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual and the last 3 5 gave more vague answers such as don t know other or did not respond to the question In the United States according to a Williams Institute report in April 2011 96 or approximately 250 million of the adult population are heterosexual An October 2012 Gallup poll provided unprecedented demographic information about those who identify as heterosexual arriving at the conclusion that 96 6 with a margin of error of 1 of all U S adults identify as heterosexual The Gallup results show In a 2015 YouGov survey of 1 000 adults of the United States 89 of the sample identified as heterosexual 4 as homosexual 2 as homosexual male and 2 as homosexual female and 4 as bisexual of either sex Bailey et al in their 2016 review stated that in recent Western surveys about 93 of men and 87 of women identify as completely heterosexual and about 4 of men and 10 of women as mostly heterosexual  

*: Academic study 

 

**: Biological and environmental 

No simple and singular determinant for sexual orientation has been conclusively demonstrated but scientists believe that a combination of genetic hormonal and environmental factors determine sexual orientation They favor biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation as there is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial biological causes than social ones especially for males Factors related to the development of a heterosexual orientation include genes prenatal hormones and brain structure and their interaction with the environment  

***: Prenatal hormones 

The neurobiology of the masculinization of the brain is fairly well understood Estradiol and testosterone which is catalyzed by the enzyme 5 reductase into dihydrotestosterone act upon androgen receptors in the brain to masculinize it If there are few androgen receptors people with androgen insensitivity syndrome or too much androgen females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia there can be physical and psychological effects It has been suggested that both male and female heterosexuality are the results of this process In these studies heterosexuality in females is linked to a lower amount of masculinization than is found in lesbian females though when dealing with male heterosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than homosexual males

Sexual reproduction in the animal world is facilitated through opposite sex sexual activity although there are also animals that reproduce asexually including protozoa and lower invertebrates Reproductive sex does not require a heterosexual orientation since sexual orientation typically refers to a long term enduring pattern of sexual and emotional attraction leading often to long term social bonding while reproduction requires as little as a single act of copulation to fertilize the ovum by sperm  

**: Sexual fluidity 

Often sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity are not distinguished which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual s life and may or may not align with biological sex sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation Sexual orientation is stable and unlikely to change for the vast majority of people but some research indicates that some people may experience change in their sexual orientation and this is more likely for women than for men The American Psychological Association distinguishes between sexual orientation an innate attraction and sexual orientation identity which may change at any point in a person s life A 2012 study found that 2 of a sample of 2 560 adult participants reported a change of sexual orientation identity after a 10 year period For men a change occurred in 0 78 of those who had identified as heterosexual 9 52 of homosexuals and 47 of bisexuals For women a change occurred in 1 36 of heterosexuals 63 6 of lesbians and 64 7 of bisexuals A 2 year study by Lisa M Diamond on a sample of 80 non heterosexual female adolescents age 16 23 reported that half of the participants had changed sexual minority identities more than once one third of them during the 2 year follow up Diamond concluded that although sexual attractions appear fairly stable sexual identities and behaviors are more fluid Heteroflexibility is a form of sexual orientation or situational sexual behavior characterized by minimal homosexual activity in an otherwise primarily heterosexual orientation that is considered to distinguish it from bisexuality It has been characterized as mostly straight  

**: Sexual orientation change efforts 

Sexual orientation change efforts are methods that aim to change sexual orientation used to try to convert homosexual and bisexual people to heterosexuality Scientists and mental health professionals generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a choice There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor that conclude that sexual orientation change efforts are effective  

*: Society and culture 

A heterosexual couple a man and woman in an intimate relationship form the core of a nuclear family Many societies throughout history have insisted that a marriage take place before the couple settle down but enforcement of this rule or compliance with it has varied considerably  

**: Symbolism 

Heterosexual symbolism dates back to the earliest artifacts of humanity with gender symbols ritual fertility carvings and primitive art This was later expressed in the symbolism of fertility rites and polytheistic worship which often included images of human reproductive organs such as lingam in Hinduism Modern symbols of heterosexuality in societies derived from European traditions still reference symbols used in these ancient beliefs One such image is a combination of the symbol for Mars the Roman god of war as the definitive male symbol of masculinity and Venus the Roman goddess of love and beauty as the definitive female symbol of femininity The unicode character for this combined symbol is U 26A4  

**: Historical views 

There was no need to coin a term such as heterosexual until there was something else to contrast and compare it with Jonathan Ned Katz dates the definition of heterosexuality as it is used today to the late 19th century According to Katz in the Victorian era sex was seen as a means to achieve reproduction and relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual The body was thought of as a tool for procreation Human energy thought of as a closed and severely limited system was to be used in producing children and in work not wasted in libidinous pleasures Katz argues that modern ideas of sexuality and eroticism began to develop in America and Germany in the later 19th century The changing economy and the transformation of the family from producer to consumer resulted in shifting values The Victorian work ethic had changed pleasure became more highly valued and this allowed ideas of human sexuality to change Consumer culture had created a market for the erotic pleasure became commoditized At the same time medical doctors began to acquire more power and influence They developed the medical model of normal love in which healthy men and women enjoyed sex as part of a new ideal of male female relationships that included an essential necessary normal eroticism This model also had a counterpart the Victorian Sex Pervert anyone who failed to meet the norm The basic oppositeness of the sexes was the basis for normal healthy sexual attraction The attention paid the sexual abnormal created a need to name the sexual normal the better to distinguish the average him and her from the deviant it The creation of the term heterosexual consolidated the social existence of the pre existing heterosexual experience and created a sense of ensured and validated normalcy within it  

**: Religious views 

The Judeo Christian tradition has several scriptures related to heterosexuality The Book of Genesis states that God created women because It is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him and that Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh For the most part religious traditions in the world reserve marriage to heterosexual unions but there are exceptions including certain Buddhist and Hindu traditions Unitarian Universalists Metropolitan Community Church some Anglican dioceses and some Quaker United Church of Canada and Reform and Conservative Jewish congregations Almost all religions believe that sex between a man and a woman within marriage is allowed but there are a few that believe that it is a sin such as The Shakers The Harmony Society and The Ephrata Cloister These religions tend to view all sexual relations as sinful and promote celibacy Some religions require celibacy for certain roles such as Catholic priests however the Catholic Church also views heterosexual marriage as sacred and necessary  

**: Heteronormativity and heterosexism 

Heteronormativity denotes or relates to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation for people to have It can assign strict gender roles to males and females The term was popularized by Michael Warner in 1991 Feminist Adrienne Rich argues that compulsory heterosexuality a continual and repeating reassertion of heterosexual norms is a facet of heterosexism Compulsory heterosexuality is the idea that female heterosexuality is both assumed and enforced by a patriarchal society Heterosexuality is then viewed as the natural inclination or obligation by both sexes Consequently anyone who differs from the normalcy of heterosexuality is deemed deviant or abhorrent Heterosexism is a form of bias or discrimination in favor of opposite sex sexuality and relationships It may include an assumption that everyone is heterosexual and may involve various kinds of discrimination against gays lesbians bisexuals asexuals heteroflexible people or transgender or non binary individuals Straight pride is a slogan that arose in the late 1980s and early 1990s and has been used primarily by social conservative groups as a political stance and strategy The term is described as a response to gay pride adopted by various LGBT groups in the early 1970s or to the accommodations provided to gay pride initiatives

Page Title - Aromanticism

*: Definition, identity and relationships 

Aromanticism is defined as having little or no romantic feeling towards others experiencing little or no romantic desire or attraction The term aromantic was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2018 The opposite of aromanticism is alloromanticism defined as a romantic orientation in which one experiences romantic love or romantic attraction to others Some individuals who fall on the aromantic spectrum of identities describe themselves as having experienced romantic love or romantic attraction at some point Such aromantics may adopt labels for more specific identities on the aromantic spectrum such as grayromantic romantic attraction rarely experienced or only weakly experienced or demiromantic only experiencing romantic attraction after a strong emotional bond has been formed with the target As the experience of romantic attraction is subjective some aromantic people may find it difficult to determine whether they experience romantic attraction As such those who are aromantic may have trouble distinguishing platonic affection from romantic affection Although some aromantic people may choose to enter a romantic relationship they are less likely than alloromantic individuals to do so Aromantic people can also form non romantic relationships of all types as well as being able to enjoy sexual relationships They may also choose to have children and studies indicate that aromantic individuals are no less likely to have children than alloromantic individuals This is because aromanticism is independent of sexuality or libido and while many aromantic people are asexual many are also allosexual Due to this aromantic people who are not asexual can also identify with other sexual orientations such as aromantic bisexual or aromantic heterosexual This split between romantic and sexual orientation is commonly explained as the split attraction model which states that romantic and sexual attraction are not strictly linked for all people Aromantic asexual people are colloquially known as aro ace or aroace Aromantic individuals are also able to experience platonic love and may have committed friendships and some form intimate non romantic partnerships called queerplatonic relationships Of those who responded to the Aromantic Census 2020 14 6 had been in a non romantic partnership Some have argued that aromanticism is under represented under researched and frequently misunderstood In society at large aromantic people are often stigmatized and stereotyped as being afraid of intimacy heartless or deluded Amatonormativity a neologism coined by philosopher and professor Elizabeth Brake defined as the widespread assumption that everyone is better off in an exclusive romantic long term coupled relationship and that everyone is seeking such a relationship can be particularly damaging to aromantics Amatonormativity is said to be connected to devaluing familial platonic and queerplatonic friendships relationships damaging to aromantics In the initialism LGBTQIA the A stands for aromanticism alongside asexuality and agender  

**: Sub-identities on the aromantic spectrum 

As aromanticism exists as a spectrum commonly referred to as the aromantic spectrum there are varying sub identities or microlabels that people on the aromantic spectrum identify with Aromantic someone who experiences little to no romantic attraction Grayromantic someone who may be experiencing romantic attraction rarely only under certain circumstances or only weakly Demiromantic someone who experiences romantic attraction but only after forming a close non romantic bond with the person Aegoromantic someone who does not feel romantic attraction but enjoys the depiction of romantic love Lithromantic someone who experiences romantic attraction but does not want it to be reciprocated and may lose that attraction if it is reciprocated Cupioromantic someone who does not experience romantic attraction but desires a romantic relationship Aroflux someone who experiences their romantic attraction to be shifting on the aromantic spectrum Frayromantic someone who only experiences romantic attraction towards people they do not know and may lose romantic attraction towards them if they form a deeper connection with them Quoiromantic someone who is uncertain if they experience romantic attraction or cannot tell if their feelings are romantic sexual or platonic in nature Placioromantic someone who feels little to no desire to receive romantic acts but has interest in performing them to someone else Apothiromantic someone who does not experience romantic attraction and feels repulsed by romance or averse to romantic activities Beyond the above listed commonly used terms that people on the aromantic spectrum may use to identify with there are also a series of newer emerging terms that are not yet commonly used by the community  

*: Community 

One of the earliest uses of the modern term aromantic dates back to 2005 The early online community around aromanticism formed on the Asexual Visibility and Education Network AVEN an online community around asexuality and social media platforms such as tumblr Since then a dedicated online community centered around aromanticism has formed online on Arocalypse com as well as other social media platforms such as reddit on the aromantic sub reddit In order to gain wider acceptance and recognition a volunteer formed organization the Aromantic spectrum Union for Recognition Education and Advocacy AUREA was formed to increase recognition of and education on aromanticism and help people on the aromantic spectrum gain wider acceptance by the general public AUREA is also the leading organizer of the annual Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week held in February Another community organization The Ace and Aro Advocacy Project TAAAP focuses on providing resources around both asexuality and aromanticism to the public They do so by creating and hosting workshops developing educational materials and engaging in outreach within the LGBTQIA community and general public The organization has also written a book titled Ace and Aro Journeys A Guide to Embracing your Asexual or Aromantic Identity that was published in April 2023

*: Discrimination and cultural erasure 

Discrimination fear and prejudice against aromantic people commonly referred to as arophobia or when directed at both aromantic and asexual aspec people aphobia is prevalent in both the general public as well as within the LGBTQIA community Elizabeth Brake coined the term amatonormativity in the book Minimizing Marriage meaning the pressure or desire for monogamy romance and or marriage As aromanticism is directly counter to many western societal expectations aromantic people face continued pressure and prejudice to conform to the social norms and form permanent romantic relationships Although aromantics and asexuals have existed for as long as humans have the terminology and openness has only gone mainstream more recently Aromantic people are often left out of discussions and representations including within the LGBTQIA community itself This extends to some people s and media organizations misuse of the expanded LGBT acronym LGBTQIA acronym itself wherein some people mistakenly claim that A in LGBTQIA stands for ally In actuality the A in LGBTQIA represents aromanticism asexuality and agender This erasure extends into modern TV media very prominently that of the character Jughead Jones who is asexual and aromantic in the 2017 Television show Riverdale the writers chose to depict Jughead as a heterosexual despite pleas from both fans and Jughead actor Cole Sprouse to retain Jughead s asexual aromantic identity to allow the community to be represented To counteract the stigma and discrimination against aromantic people various community and health and wellness organizations have published articles and educational materials to educate the public The English aromantic and asexual activist Yasmin Benoit called out that this erasure expands to official government offices such as the Government Equalities Office not yet acknowledging aromanticism in their latest LGBT Survey and people having to label themselves under other instead It is worth noting that sometimes this erasure of aromantic identities even happens within the aspec community itself with people assuming that aromanticism and asexuality are the same thing when in actuality they are actually different things and many aromantic people do not identify as asexual In the Aromantic Census 2020 82 43 of respondents reported not being taken seriously being ignored or being dismissed by others 48 34 reported having experienced attempts or suggestions to fix or cure them 70 51 of respondents indicated some impact of discrimination against their aromantic identity  

*: Research 

As the general term of aromanticism is still relatively young studies on aromanticism in the scientific research field are still scarce and under researched and of the few studies that exist many treat aromanticism as a sub set of asexuality In April 2023 two University of Toronto professors launched the Asexuality and Aromanticism Bibliography to better collect and track academic articles on asexuality and aromanticism The concept that there is a distinction between romantic and sexual orientation has not been studied extensively yet but the diversity of attraction has been progressively recognized in newer studies A 2022 study on concordance between romantic orientation and sexual attitudes found that while there is some concordance between romantic orientation and sexual orientation the two were not a complete match suggesting that the experience of split attraction between romantic and sexual orientation exists both in allosexual as well in asexual people The authors also note that they were surprised that out of their sample population as compared to asexual participants only few allosexual people self identified as aromantic and hypothesize that this may be due to the unfamiliarity with the concept and term According to Debra Laino an AASECT certified clinical sexologist and relationship coach one of the most common misconceptions around aromantic people is that they do not want to have sex She explains that aromantic people can still feel sexual attraction but they might not identify with the way romance is often present in current media and culture A research article from 2021 discusses zines and their role within the aromantic and asexual community to help people navigate their identity and the authors note that aromanticism is too often explored as a tag on to asexuality  

**: Prevalence 

The representation of aromantic people within the general population is not yet well understood Of the population of asexual people which is believed to be approximately 1 of the general population about 26 also identified as aromantic There is however not much qualitative or quantitative research around how many allosexual people also identify as aromantic thus making it hard to say how much of the general public identifies as aromantic One study of 414 American adults found that about 1 of participants indicated that they were not romantically attracted to either sex i e aromantic The study also found that about 10 6 of participants had discordant different romantic and sexual orientations  

**: Calls for more research on aromanticism 

Aromanticism as its own term originated within the asexual community online but newer research is acknowledging that romantic and sexual orientation are not one and the same and attitudes towards recognition of this separation and difference are changing A contributing factor to this is that many people have difficulty distinguishing between romantic and sexual attraction as they intertwined for most people and that between 19 and 28 of asexual individuals do also identify as aromantic Calls for more research around aromanticism and asexuality are highlighted by a recent study centered on the thematic analysis of online communications within the aromantic and asexual community which highlights that allonormativity is prevalent in the field of communication studies and needs to be combated in order to provide qualitative academic work around aromanticism and asexuality In January 2024 PRIDEnet a project of Stanford University School of Medicine published a report as a result of a series of research community listening sessions with members of the aromantic community held in 2023 in recognition of the need for more affirming research related to the aromantic community to address the lack of information surrounding the social mental and physical health of aromantic people and help us understand the challenges faced by and the resilience of the aromantic community  

**: Community research 

The Aromantic spectrum Union for Recognition Education and Advocacy AUREA is supporting researchers interested in studying the field of aromanticism and hosts an archive of research on aromanticism Some of the research listed is peer reviewed but the organization has also supported some community surveys A Census was performed by AUREA in 2020 to gather information of the aromantic community The census received 9 758 responses from aromantics around the world Of the respondents a majority identified as asexual but about a third of respondents did not identify as asexual highlighting that aromanticism is not strictly a subset of asexuality and should not simply be categorized as such The Census Authors acknowledged that the respondent participant pool was overrepresented by people identifying as asexual as well as other geographic demographic and linguistic skews as the census was only available in English and due to the predominantly online recruitment method The organization is planning to repeat the census on a semi annual basis but has not yet released the 2022 census Another community survey was performed in 2021 within the aromantic community specifically targeting the allosexual aromantic community to highlight the existence of aromantic people that are not asexual The survey had 647 responses the majority of respondents identified as queer at 43 and only 8 8 as heterosexual

Page Title - Discrimination against intersex people

*: Protection from discrimination 

A 2013 first international pilot study Human Rights between the Sexes by Dan Christian Ghattas found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a disorder in all areas in which Western medicine prevails They are more or less obviously treated as sick or abnormal depending on the respective society The United Nations states that intersex people suffer stigma on the basis of physical characteristics including violations of their rights to health and physical integrity to be free from torture and ill treatment and to equality and non discrimination The UN has called for governments to end discrimination against intersex people Ban discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics intersex traits or status including in education health care employment sports and access to public services and consult intersex people and organizations when developing legislation and policies that impact their rights A handful of jurisdictions so far provide explicit protection from discrimination for intersex people South Africa was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation as part of the attribute of sex Australia was the first country to add an independent attribute of intersex status Malta was the first to adopt a broader framework of sex characteristics through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons Since then several countries in Southeastern Europe have prohibited discrimination based on sex characteristics of intersex status Albania since 2020 Bosnia and Herzegovina since 2016 Greece since 2015 and Serbia since 2021 currently prohibit discrimination based on sex characteristics while Montenegro prohibits discrimination based on intersex characteristics since 2017 Iceland bans employment discrimination based on sex characteristics since 2018 The Netherlands since 2019 Belgium since 2020 and Denmark since 2022 also prohibit discrimination based on sex characteristics Pakistan prohibits discrimination against intersex people khusra since 2018 India also prohibits discrimination against person with intersex variations since 2020 Since 2022 Chile is the first Latin American country that provide legal protection from discrimination based on sex characteristics  

*: Right to life 

Intersex people face genetic de selection via pregnancy terminations and preimplantation genetic diagnosis as well as abandonment neglect infanticide and murder due to their sex characteristics In 2015 the Council of Europe published an Issue Paper on Human rights and intersex people remarking Intersex people s right to life can be violated in discriminatory sex selection and preimplantation genetic diagnosis other forms of testing and selection for particular characteristics Such de selection or selective abortions are incompatible with ethics and human rights standards due to the discrimination perpetrated against intersex people on the basis of their sex characteristics In 2015 Chinese news reported a case of abandonment of an infant thought likely due to its sex characteristics Hong Kong activist Small Luk reports that this is not uncommon in part due to the historic imposition of a policy of one child per family Cases of infanticide attempted infanticide and neglect have been reported in China Uganda and Pakistan Kenyan reports suggest that the birth of an intersex infant may be viewed as a curse In 2015 it was reported that an intersex Kenyan adolescent Muhadh Ishmael was mutilated and later died Ishmael had previously been described as a curse on his family  

*: Medical 

In places with accessible healthcare systems intersex people face harmful practices including involuntary or coercive treatment and in places without such systems infanticide abandonment and mutilation may occur  

**: Physical integrity and bodily autonomy 

Intersex people face involuntary or coerced medical treatment from infancy Where these occur without personal informed consent these are violations of their rights to health and physical integrity to be free from torture and ill treatment and to equality and non discrimination A 2016 Australian study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60 had received medical treatment on the basis of their sex characteristics half receiving such treatments aged under 18 years most commonly genital surgeries many of which occurred in infancy and hormone treatments and the majority experienced at least one negative impact Overall while some parents and physicians had attempted to empower participants the study found strong evidence suggesting a pattern of institutionalised shaming and coercive treatment and poor or no information provision 16 of study participants were not provided with information on options of having no treatment and some were provided with misinformation about the nature of their treatment and information about peer support was also lacking OII Europe reports A German study conducted by a medical team between 2005 and 2007 covered the experiences of 439 intersex individuals of all ages from Germany Austria and Switzerland 81 had been subjected to one or multiple surgeries due to their DSD diagnosis Almost 50 of the participating adults reported psychological problems and a variety of problems related to their physical well being and their sex life Two thirds made a connection between those problems and the medical and surgical treatment they had been subjected to Participating children reported significant disturbances especially within their family life and in relation with their physical well being Rationales for medical intervention frequently focus on parental distress or problematize future gender identity and sexuality and subjective judgements are made about the acceptability of risk of future gender dysphoria Medical professionals have traditionally considered the worst outcomes after genital reconstruction in infancy to occur when the person develops a gender identity discordant with the sex assigned as an infant Human rights institutions question such approaches as being informed by redundant social constructs around gender and biology Decision making on any cancer and other physical risks may be intertwined with normalizing rationales In a major Parliamentary report in Australia published in October 2013 the Senate Community Affairs References committee was disturbed by the possible implications of current practices in the treatment of cancer risk The committee stated clinical intervention pathways stated to be based on probabilities of cancer risk may be encapsulating treatment decisions based on other factors such as the desire to conduct normalising surgery Treating cancer may be regarded as unambiguously therapeutic treatment while normalising surgery may not Thus basing a decision on cancer risk might avoid the need for court oversight in a way that a decision based on other factors might not The committee is disturbed by the possible implications of this Despite the naming of clinician statements as consensus statements there remains no clinical consensus about the conduct of surgical interventions nor their evidence base surgical timing necessity type of surgical intervention and degree of difference warranting intervention Surgery may adversely impact physical sensation and capacity for intimacy however research has suggested that parents are willing to consent to appearance altering surgeries even at the cost of later adult sexual sensation Other research shows that parents may make different choices with non medicalized information Child rights experts suggest that parents have no right to consent to such treatments Clinical decision making is frequently portrayed as a choice between early or later surgical interventions while human rights advocates and some clinicians portray concerns as matters of consent and autonomy  

**: Medical photography and display 

Photographs of intersex children s genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes and individuals with intersex traits may be subjected to repeated genital examinations and display to medical teams Sharon Preves described this as a form of humiliation and stigmatization leading to an inability to deflect negative associations of self where genitalia must be revealed in order to allow for stigmatization According to Creighton et al the experience of being photographed has exemplified for many people with intersex conditions the powerlessness and humiliation felt during medical investigations and interventions  

**: Access to medical services 

Adults with intersex variations report poor mental health due to experiences of medicalization with many individuals avoiding care as a result Many Australian study participants stated a need to educate their physicians Similar reports are made elsewhere reports on the situation in Mexico suggests that adults may not receive adequate care including lack of understanding about intersex bodies and examinations that cause physical harm In countries without accessible healthcare systems infanticide abandonment and mutilation may occur Access to necessary medical services for example due to cancer or urinary issues is also limited  

*: Inciting hate crimes by allegations of sex crimes 

One increasingly common cause of hate crimes against intersex people is the neurological claim that male and female brains have fundamentally different sexualities in particular the claim that men are sexually impulsive and aggressive and bound to act on their sexual fantasies while most women are said to have a wider range of sexual fantasies than most men including fantasies that it would be unacceptable to act on The claim that a combination of one trait that most men have and one trait that most women have would produce a sex criminal adds up to allegations that intersex people are sex offenders To decrease such severe discrimination against intersex people some researchers advocate more public information about the error sources in the sexological studies that are said to show such sex differences This includes the possibility that societal double standards may scare more men than women into not talking about or otherwise revealing their sex fantasies corroborated by the existence of characteristics that differ between male volunteers and male nonvolunteers but not between female volunteers and female nonvolunteers in erotica research giving a false appearance of men having narrower ranges of sexual fantasies than women and the possibility that men who want to be castrated out of their spiritual beliefs may have to commit sex crimes and claim that it was due to uncontrollable urges to get castrated since such surgery is not off the shelf corroborated by the overrepresentation of religious groups in child sexual abuse scandals that cannot be explained by biopsychiatric correlations creating a false appearance of men being less able to control their sexual impulses than women Certain intersex rights advocates argue that this may dispel the myth that intersex people are hybrid degenerated to be sex criminals creating more understanding for intersex people  

*: Suicide and self-harm 

The impact of discrimination and stigma can also be seen in high rates of suicidal tendencies and self harm Multiple anecdotal reports including from Hong Kong and Kenya point to high levels of suicidality amongst intersex people The Australian sociological study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60 had thought about suicide and 42 thought about self harm on the basis of issues related to having an intersex variation 19 had attempted suicide causes identified included stigma discrimination family rejection and school bullying A 2013 German clinical study found high rates of distress with prevalence rates of self harming behavior and suicidal tendencies comparable to traumatized women with a history of physical or sexual abuse Similar results have been reported in Australia and Denmark  

*: Education 

An Australian sociological survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics published in 2016 found that 18 of respondents compared to an Australian average of 2 failed to complete secondary school with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions bullying on the basis of physical characteristics and other factors A Kenyan news report suggests high rates of early school leaving with the organisation Gama Africa reporting that 60 of 132 known intersex people had dropped out of school because of the harassment and treatment they received from their peers and their teachers The Australian study found that schools lacked inclusive services such as relevant puberty and sex education curricula and counselling for example not representing a full range of human bodily diversity Only a quarter of respondents felt positive about their schooling experiences schooling coincided with disclosure of an intersex condition associated with well being risks and early school leaving peaked during the years most associated with puberty and hormone therapy interventions Cognitive differences may also be associated with some traits such as sex chromosome variations Nevertheless in addition to very high rates of early school leaving the Australian study also found that a higher proportion of study participants completed undergraduate or postgraduate degrees compared to the general Australian population  

*: Poverty and employment discrimination 

The impact of discrimination and stigma can be seen in high rates of poverty A 2015 Australian survey of people born with atypical sex characteristics found high levels of poverty in addition to very high levels of early school leaving and higher than average rates of disability 6 of the 272 survey participants reported being homeless or couch surfing OII Europe states that stigma structural and verbal discrimination harassment as well as harmful practices and lack of legal recognition can lead to inadequate education broken careers and poverty including homelessness due to pathologisation and related trauma a disturbed family life due to taboo and medicalisation lack of self esteem and a high risk of becoming suicidal An Employers guide to intersex inclusion published by Pride in Diversity and Organisation Intersex International Australia discloses cases of discrimination in employment

Like all individuals some intersex individuals may be raised as a particular sex male or female but then identify with another later in life while most do not Like non intersex people some intersex individuals may not identify themselves as either exclusively female or exclusively male A 2012 clinical review suggests that between 8 5 and 20 of persons with intersex conditions may experience gender dysphoria while sociological research in Australia a country with a third X sex classification shows that 19 of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an X or other option while 52 are women 23 men and 6 unsure Depending on the jurisdiction access to any birth certificate may be an issue including a birth certificate with a sex marker The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that Recognition before the law means having legal personhood and the legal protections that flow from that For intersex people this is neither primarily nor solely about amending birth registrations or other official documents Firstly it is about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women Access to a birth certificate with a correct sex marker may be an issue for people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth or it may only be available accompanied by surgical requirements The passports and identification documents of Australia and some other nationalities have adopted X as a valid third category besides M male and F female at least since 2003 In 2013 Germany became the first European nation to allow babies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as indeterminate gender on birth certificates amidst opposition and skepticism from intersex organisations who point out that the law appears to mandate exclusion from male or female categories The Council of Europe acknowledged this approach and concerns about recognition of third and blank classifications in a 2015 Issue Paper stating that these may lead to forced outings and lead to an increase in pressure on parents of intersex children to decide in favour of one sex The Issue Paper argues that further reflection on non binary legal identification is necessary  

*: Sport 

Women who have or are perceived to have intersex traits are subject to stigmatization humiliation and trial by media Currently suspended IAAF regulations on hyperandrogenism mandated that national Olympic committees actively investigate any perceived deviation in sex characteristics in women athletes In 2013 it was disclosed in a medical journal that four unnamed elite female athletes from developing countries were subjected to gonadectomies sterilization and partial clitoridectomies female genital mutilation after testosterone testing revealed that they had an intersex condition Testosterone testing was introduced in the wake of the Caster Semenya case of a South African runner subjected to testing due to her appearance and vigor There is no evidence that innate hyperandrogenism in elite women athletes confers an advantage in sport While Australia protects intersex persons from discrimination the Act contains an exemption in sport  

*: LGBT 

Intersex people may face discrimination within LGBT settings and multiple organizations have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition that fail to address the issue of unnecessary normalising treatments on intersex children using the portmanteau term pinkwashing Emi Koyama has described how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex specific human rights issues including creating false impressions that intersex people s rights are protected by laws protecting LGBT people and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that while the gay community offers us a place of relative safety it is also oblivious to our specific needs Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted and some are heterosexual but LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms but in June 2016 the same organization pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBTI LGBT and intersex people are recognized while at the same time harmful practices on intersex children continue In August 2016 Zwischengeschlecht described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning intersex genital mutilations as a form of pinkwashing The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex transgender and LGBT issues instead of addressing harmful practices on infants

Some Belarusian academics are known for engaging in historical negationism and trying to culturally appropriate Lithuanian culture national identity and history of statehood by arguing that the Belarusian word litoutsy meaning Lithuanian historically refers to modern Belarusians instead whereas present day Lithuanians are pretenders who should actually be identified as letuvisy ic and are accused of stealing their ethnonym as well as the historic name of their homeland Some Belarusian scholars consider the statehood of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to be primordially Slavic rejecting the notion that its origins come from Baltic Lithuanian tribes Historian Mikola Yermalovich claimed that King Mindaugas was Belarusian whereas the epicentre of historic Lithuania was actually in central and southern Belarusian lands During the Belarusian opposition protests in 2021 a Lithuanian woman was arrested and beaten up by Belarusian OMON forces after they found out she was a Lithuanian citizen  

**: Belgium 

In 2023 statistics from the previous year alone indicated that a significant number of Lithuanians were exploited or faced discrimination at work in Belgium with Federal Public Service Employment getting around 400 complaints 168 of cases were from Lithuanians who did not receive their paycheck or it got delayed whereas 234 of them received smaller payments than their coworkers for the same work because of their background There were also accounts of Lithuanians facing racist or humiliating comments such as being called dirty Eastern European or noted as coming from the Soviet Union in their certificate of employment

In 2007 a scandal began to surface as it emerged that some Irish schools forbid Lithuanian children from using their native tongue There was a reported case of Lithuanian girls suffering physical abuse because they were considered to be more attractive than their Irish peers Inspector for Children s Rights Rimant ala evi i t stated that Lithuanian children are feeling unsafe and face discrimination and concluded that Lithuanian and Irish children were not being treated as equals In 2008 three Lithuanian men were beaten up because of their nationality by bouncers who claimed that people like them are not welcomed

During the plague of 1709 11 in the Kingdom of Prussia 270 000 Baltic people died from starvation and disease 150 000 160 000 of whom were from the Lithuanian province This was partially a consequence of Prussian leadership not sending any food aid to regions inhabited by Old Prussians and Prussian Lithuanians due to poor harvest laws forbidding them to have a sauna resulting in a lack of hygiene and servile work conditions imposed by local administrations This tragedy resulted in the near complete extinction of Old Prussians and had tremendous demographic consequences for Prussian Lithuanians Once the plague ended King Frederick William I invited colonisers from Germany Holland Switzerland France and Austria to resettle in Lithuania Minor After the creation of the German Empire in 1871 the population of Prussian Lithuanians in East Prussia started to decline even further due to Germanisation Many Lithuanians who wanted a better life were forced to adopt German culture and eventually abandoned their native tongue In Prussian governance and within the clergy German colonists were regarded as the emissaries of the chosen people tasked with the mission of Germanizing the Lithuanians as well as other ethnic groups Prominent officials consistently underscored national disparities in their writings characterizing the Lithuanian peasantry as belonging to an inferior human race predestined to serve the Germans as their slaves They also believed their culture being superior to Lithuanian culture whereas the nation itself was considered to be politically inept In 1916 a German science publication Der Koloss aut fonernen Fusen in Munich wrote T he Lithuanian himself has a tendency to superior German culture and by taking this path he can become a loyal citizen of the Reich those who think that a Lithuanian is already mature enough for even the most primitive form of self governance are deeply mistaken During World War II in accordance with Generalplan Ost the Nazis planned to commit a mass scale genocide of Lithuanians 85 were to be physically exterminated which was the second highest percentage of planned killings of an ethnic group in German occupied Europe only to be surpassed by Latgalians  

**: Latvia 

Historically Lithuanians in Latvia were called lei i which apart from its primary meaning was also used to refer to someone who is negligent lazy uneducated and illiterate Following Latvia s declaration of independence this term was soon replaced by a neologism lietuvie i due to its negative connotations and official complaints from the Lithuanian Government regarding the designation of the nationality of their compatriots in Latvian passports Philologist Aist Brusokait suggests that Latvians were the first ones to call Lithuanians zirga galva meaning horse head which was later adopted as an insult by Lithuanians themselves Since Latvians were economically more well off than Lithuanians Latvians that lived by the border used to take young Lithuanian workmen to serve on their farms to do all the dirty work Latvians were Lutherans and Lutherans always paid more attention to education Because of this Latvians were more educated than Lithuanians which is why less educated illiterate Lithuanians were sometimes looked down upon and called zirga galva Before World War II the Government of Latvia closed Lithuanian organisations and schools which contributed to many Lithuanians fleeing the country as they could no longer ensure proper education for their children In the 1950s and 60s however economically struggling Lithuanians were once again resettling in Latvia where they faced some degree of discrimination from the locals who did not consider them to be equal or trustworthy There were reported cases of inciting tensions and insults directed at the Lithuanian people as well as children bullied at school for having Lithuanian parents

***: History 

The first negative depictions of Lithuanians in Polish culture date back to the 13th century when they were perceived as wild greedy and cruel barbarians In the 15th century Polish priest Jan D ugosz described Lithuanians as barbarous shabby primitives According to historian Krzysztof Buchowski Poles mocked Lithuanians for their poverty lack of manners and untidiness Poland also held certain negative attitudes towards the Lithuanian language and culture as well Lithuanians experienced strong Polonization especially in the church with many Polish clergymen including hierarchs deeming the Lithuanian language unrefined pagan like and unsuitable for the Christian faith including its prayers or psalms Historical accounts also mention violent outbursts in churches against Lithuanian peasants because of their nationality or native tongue There was a belief amongst the Lithuanian peasantry that they should pray in Polish since Lithuanian is the language of pagans and therefore God cannot understand it When comparing historical discrimination faced by Latvians under German rule linguist Alvydas Butkus notes that Latvians were becoming cultured as Latvians whereas the preliminary condition for Lithuanian and Latgalian peasants to be cultured was Polish language and Polish national identity According to historian Alvydas Nik entaitis Polish literature also played its role in reinforcing Polish prejudice towards Lithuanians In Polish historical consciousness there is no place for 20th century events the formation of the modern Lithuanian nation is ignored and Lithuania is being seen through the creative prism of Adam Mickiewicz and Henryk Sienkiewicz Lithuanian is a Polish loving barbarian who should be grateful to Poland for each and every civilizational accomplishment After the Polish Lithuanian War Lithuanian captives experienced inhumane treatment by the Polish when transported to Galicia they were deprived of food insulted and pelted with apples and stones Some prisoners died from starvation In January 1921 a Polish military regime in the Vilnius Region was introduced Local Lithuanians faced severe repressions they were punished for letting their children go to Lithuanian schools possessing illegal press and refusing to participate in rigged elections as they were persecuted fined or imprisoned Many Lithuanian intellectuals faced expulsion from their homeland and the Gymnasium of Vilnius was shut down Some Lithuanian students turned up in protest but they were brutally cracked down by police As described by journalist Jeronimas Cic nas When police ousted gymnasium principal M Bir i ka and the director of the teacher s seminary J Kairi k tis from the premises the Lithuanian anthem could be heard in the street The alarm of the police immediately followed A dozen students were beaten until they were bleeding Practically all were hit by gunstocks sticks and rocks I remember when we retreated to the nearby streets But in Vilnius and Suba ius Streets we were being beaten once again Following the annexation of the Republic of Central Lithuania in 1922 Poland actively promoted Polonisation policies aimed to assimilate Lithuanians they were not allowed to do civil service have Lithuanian surnames or baptise their children with Lithuanian names During sermons Polish priests compared Lithuanians to pagans their native tongue was presented as unsuitable for prayers Ordinary Poles would also openly demonstrate their anti Lithuanian sentiment there are numerous reported cases of vandalism when they would smash Lithuanian windows on February 16 and even try to break into their apartments According to journalist Rapolas Mackonis Constant debilitating persecutions harassment and hatred towards Lithuanians at every step resulted in unbearable life and work conditions Many Lithuanians could not take it and one by one some on wheels some by foot fled to the West Besides many could not get passports and had to scram for this reason alone Others faced exile 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania raised tensions as Poles living in Vilnius held signs saying Those who beat Lithuanians live a hundred years and Death to Lithuanians During World War II the Polish resistance forces organised mass killings of innocent Lithuanians On April 25 1943 Home Army executed at least 11 Lithuanian civilians in No ia village Rodun after they told them they identified themselves as Lithuanians On May 12 of the same year Polish partisans killed two Lithuanians in Rimd i nai village Gerv iai by nearly ripping a woman in half and by cutting off the scalp of a man In January 1944 Home Army attacked Knicekai village in Ei i k s and massacred 35 Lithuanian civilians with 13 being injured and 40 farms burned to the ground In the early morning of February 10 1944 Lithuanians in Rudamina were instructed to leave the Vilnius Region within the next 12 hours or be hanged Such orders were also given to 330 Lithuanian families living in Mai iagala and Paber On June 23 1944 in response to the Glinciszki massacre which was a Lithuanian revenge campaign for killing their auxiliary policemen the Polish resistance movement Home Army killed up to 200 innocent Lithuanian civilians by Polish accounts 27 in the Dubingiai massacre The victims included newborns children women and the elderly They also killed 273 Lithuanians in Mol tai from 1943 to 1945 Around 4 000 people were murdered by Polish partisans in ethnic Lithuania alone In 1993 the General Prosecutor s Office of the Republic of Lithuania concluded that the partisan units of the Home Army who did not recognise the return of Vilnius to Lithuania in 1939 committed genocide against the Lithuanian people

After the partitions of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth most of Lithuania proper fell under Russian rule From the early 19th century Russian ethnic policies concerning annexed land were different unlike in Poland Latvia Estonia or Finland where Russians imposed more mild integration policies mainly seeking to turn them into loyal subjects of the state Lithuanians together with Belarusians and Ukrainians faced assimilation The unsuccessful January Uprising 1863 64 resulted in Governor General Mikhail Muravyov initiating the Programme of Restoration of Russian Beginnings that claimed Lithuanian land being Russian since ancient times In 1863 Lithuanian publications in Latin script were banned From 1872 only the Cyrillic script was allowed and Lithuanian was banned in schools Following the occupation of East Prussia around 130 000 Prussian Lithuanians suffered from ethnic cleansing as they were slaughtered by the Red Army Thousands of local orphans also known as wolf children In Lithuanian vilko vaikai were left behind to fend for themselves with many Prussian Lithuanian children escaping to Lithuania proper by crossing Neman According to the Research Centre of Lithuania In Lithuania Minor and all of East Prussia there were almost no settlements where the Soviets wouldn t have killed and tortured the civilian population destroyed or pillaged their property Men were killed and women were raped NKGB officer Kuzmyn in Klaip da writes In Klaip da and ilut there are all around rapes of women happening regardless of their nationality physical stance or age The beautiful city of ilut that was left by the Germans without a battle now looks repulsive In 1947 the Council of Lithuania Minor in Fulda Germany protested against the ethnic crimes and Russian colonisation of their homeland Some historians deny accusations of genocide against Prussian Lithuanians claiming it to be the result of soldier brutality In 2006 this massacre has been recognised by Lithuania as genocide against the Prussian Lithuanian people carried out by the Soviet regime During the Soviet times the famous slogan Lithuania shall remain but without Lithuanians by statesman Mikhail Susnov was coined Once Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 immediate Russification followed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would give administration positions in Lithuanian SSR to Russian representatives who usually could not speak Lithuanian ethnic Russians were encouraged to resettle in Lithuania In some governmental institutions of Soviet Lithuania the Lithuanian language was banned In 1948 80 of all communists in Lithuania were Russians whereas only 18 5 of them were Lithuanians with the situation slightly improving after Stalin s death In 1953 the leadership of the Lithuanian SSR indirectly admitted that there were attempts to Russify Lithuania and plans to eliminate politics of national character In the 1980s Russification intensified in public life as well it was mandatory for the Lithuanian Communist Party to report on their progress regarding Russification From 1972 Lithuanian names were started to be written in accordance with Eastern Slavic naming customs as patronyms were introduced

Similarly to the Soviet Union modern Russia has also been accused of historical negationism claiming Kaliningrad to be primordially Russian land despite the region sharing much closer cultural ties with its neighbouring countries and being historic Baltic land of Prussian Lithuanians and Old Prussians for centuries Historical book The Western Part of the Lithuanian Ethnographic Territory written by Professor Pavel Kushner Knyshev exploring Baltic people s ties to the region has been removed from all libraries of Kaliningrad and mainland Russia with possibly only a few copies in archives remaining Lithuanian authorities have received several reports about the unfounded removal of Lithuanian monuments In 2003 a bust of Kristijonas Donelaitis in Gusev was desecrated with oil paint before its unveiling ceremony the periodical Kaliningradskaya Pravda did not investigate the incident In 2022 a memorial plaque in Sovetsk dedicated to philosopher Wilhelm Storost Vyd nas has been removed Kaliningrad authorities have also removed a stone sculpture commemorating the famous Prussian resistance leader Herkus Monte In the present day political context Lithuanians themselves are oftentimes framed as nazis or fascists by the Russian state media and press due to the Lithuanian killing squad Ypatingasis b rys carrying out atrocities against the Jewish population during the Holocaust and Lithuanian leadership defending partisans of questionable reputation Russian programmes have also come under scrutiny for using deceitful language when spreading false historical narratives about Lithuania most notable examples include insinuating that Lithuanians served in a national Waffen SS legion or labelling Antanas Smetona s regime as fascist from which Lithuania was then liberated by the Soviets even though Moscow originally supported its initiators and even funded press publications owned by Nationalists In 2015 Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky threatened the territorial integrity of Lithuania by urging Russia to take back Klaip da and Vilnius on national television In 2022 the State Dume of Russia has registered a bill which proposes repealing Russia s resolution recognising Lithuania s independence In 2023 reacting to President of Lithuania Naus da s encouragement to send more military aid to Ukraine Russian television host Vladimir Solovyov made claims suggesting that Lithuania is not worthy of its independence threatened the future of its sovereignty and asked Why do we put up with their existence There have been instances of Russian ethnically motivated violence directed against the Lithuanians living in Lithuania In 2020 a 24 year old Russian man who received political asylum physically assaulted a Lithuanian teacher in Visaginas for teaching Russians Lithuanian in school and called Lithuanians man eaters Lithuanians have also been attacked for addressing Russian speakers in Lithuanian either as pedestrians or clients  

**: United Kingdom 

Lithuanians have reported facing double standards when seeking to come to the United Kingdom There have been reports of Lithuanians having to pay 55 more for obtaining a UK visa than citizens from other EU countries Despite Britain s official explanation that the larger price is a result of Lithuania not ratifying the Social Charter of the European Commission of 1961 Embassy of Lithuania claimed this decision to be discriminatory and not fully convincing as the country did ratify the Social Charter of 1986 which f rom a legal stance is not a more inferior document Post Brexit amendments affecting labour migration in Britain have also been seen as discriminatory against Lithuanian workers as it will cost much more for employers to employ them in comparison to other nationals In the words of the representative for IOM Audra Sipavi ien additional taxes for employers may contribute to Lithuanians being discriminated against in the labour market This means there will be no interest in taking a more expensive Lithuanian instead of a cheaper Latvian There have been several instances of hostility towards Lithuanian migrants accompanied by property damage although motives for such attacks may vary In 2016 a twelve year old Lithuanian boy was beaten up in Manchester because of his nationality by his British peer who was ordered to do so by his mother waiting for him in the car Many Lithuanian families have claimed their children suffered abuse in public schools because of their nationality

Page Title - Blood libel

*: History 

The earliest versions of the accusations involving Jews supposedly crucifying Christian children on Easter Passover is said to be because of a prophecy There is no reference to the use of blood in unleavened matzo bread at this time yet which develops later as a major motivation for the crime  

**: Possible precursors 

The earliest known antecedent is from a man named Democritus not the philosopher mentioned in the Suda who alleged that every seven years the Jews captured a stranger brought him to the temple in Jerusalem and sacrificed him cutting his flesh into bits The Greco Egyptian author Apion claimed that the Jews sacrificed Greek victims in their temple Here the writer states that when Antiochus Epiphanes entered the temple in Jerusalem he discovered a Greek captive who told him that he was being fattened for sacrifice Every year Apion claimed the Jews would sacrifice a Greek and consume his flesh at the same time swearing eternal hatred towards the Greeks Apion s claim likely reflects already circulating attitudes towards Jews as similar claims are made by Posidonius and Apollonius Molon in the 1st century BCE This idea is exampled later in history when Socrates Scholasticus fl 5th century reported that in a drunken frolic a group of Jews bound a Christian child to a cross in mockery of the death of Christ and scourged him until he died  

**: Medieval context 

The blood libels emerged at a time when the church and particularly the Crusades were driving increasingly anti Judaic discourses These were later reinforced through the Church council Lateran IV which mandated the segregation of Christian and Jewish society and built an apparatus of enforcement across Europe At a local context many of the English examples may have included an element of church competition for saintly cults with the income that veneration produced Israel Yuval proposed that the blood libel may have originated in the 12th century due to Christian views on Jewish behavior during the First Crusade Some Jews committed suicide and killed their own children rather than exposing them to forced conversion to Christianity Yuval wrote that Christians may have argued that if Jews could kill their own children they could also kill Christian children  

**: Origins in England 

In England in 1144 the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of ritual murder after a boy William of Norwich was found dead in the woods with stab wounds William s hagiographer Thomas of Monmouth falsely claimed that every year there is an international council of Jews at which they choose the country in which a child will be killed during Easter because of a Jewish prophecy that states that the killing of a Christian child each year will ensure that the Jews will be restored to the Holy Land According to Monmouth England was chosen in 1144 and the leaders of the Jewish community delegated the Jews of Norwich to perform the killing after which they abducted and crucified William The legend was turned into a cult with William acquiring the status of a martyr and pilgrims bringing offerings to the local church This was followed by similar accusations in Gloucester 1168 Bury St Edmunds 1181 and Bristol 1183 In 1189 the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of Richard the Lionheart was attacked by the crowd Massacres of Jews at London and York soon followed In 1190 on 16 March 150 Jews were attacked in York and then massacred when they took refuge in the royal castle where Clifford s Tower now stands with some committing suicide rather than being taken by the mob The remains of 17 bodies thrown in a well in Norwich between the 12th and 13th century five that were shown by DNA testing to likely be members of a single Jewish family were very possibly killed as part of one of these pogroms After the death of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln there were trials and executions of Jews The case was described by Matthew Paris and later by Chaucer and formed the basis of the Sir Hugh ballads which have circulated to the present day Its notoriety sprang from the intervention of the Crown the first time an accusation of ritual killing had been given royal credibility The eight year old Hugh disappeared at Lincoln on 31 July 1255 His body was probably discovered on 29 August in a well A Jew named Copin or Koppin confessed to involvement He confessed to John of Lexington a servant of the crown and relative of the Bishop of Lincoln He confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose King Henry III who had reached Lincoln at the beginning of October had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London where 18 of them were executed The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans or Dominicans Within a few decades Jews would be expelled from all of England in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1657 After the expulsion Edward I renovated Little Saint Hugh s shrine and decorated it with his Royal insignia as part of his efforts to justify his actions As Stacey notes A more explicit identification of the crown with the ritual crucifixion charge can hardly be imagined  

**: Continental Europe 

Much like the blood libel of England the history of blood libel in continental Europe consists of unsubstantiated claims made about the corpses of Christian children There were frequently associated supernatural events speculated about these discoveries and corpses events which were often attributed by contemporaries to miracles Also just as in England these accusations in continental Europe typically resulted in the execution of numerous Jews sometimes even all or close to all the Jews in one town These accusations and their effects also in some cases led to royal interference on behalf of the Jews Thomas of Monmouth s story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent An early version appears in Bonum Universale de Apibus ii 29 23 by Thomas of Cantimpr a monastery near Cambray Thomas wrote in around 1260 It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations Thomas of Cantimpr also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to Pontius Pilate His blood be on us and on our children Matthew 27 25 they have been afflicted with hemorrhages a condition equated with male menstruation A very learned Jew who in our day has been converted to the Christian faith informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them toward the close of his life made the following prediction Be assured that relief from this secret ailment to which you are exposed can only be obtained through Christian blood solo sanguine Christiano This suggestion was followed by the ever blind and impious Jews who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province in order that they might recover from their malady Thomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet who by his expression solo sanguine Christiano had meant not the blood of any Christian but that of Jesus the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering Thomas did not mention the name of the very learned proselyte but it may have been Nicholas Donin of La Rochelle who in 1240 had a disputation on the Talmud with Yechiel of Paris and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with Nicholas Nicholas Donin and another Jewish convert Theobald of Cambridge are greatly credited with the adoption and the belief of the blood libel myth in Europe The first known case outside England was in Blois France in 1171 This was the site of a blood libel accusation against the town s entire Jewish community that led to around 31 33 Jews with 17 women making up this total being burned to death on 29 May of that year or the 20th of Sivan of 4931 The blood libel revolved around R Isaac a Jew whom a Christian servant reported had deposited a murdered Christian in the Loire The child s body was never found The count had about 40 adult Blois Jews arrested and they were eventually to be burned The surviving members of the Blois Jewish community as well as surviving holy texts were ransomed As a result of this case the Jews garnered new promises from the king The burned bodies of the sentenced Jews were supposedly maintained unblemished through the burning a claim which is a well known miracle martyr myth for both Jews and Christians There is significant primary source material from this case including a letter revealing moves for Jewish protection with King Louis VII Responding to the mass execution the Twentieth of Sivan was declared a fast day by Rabbenu Tam In this case in Blois there was not yet the myth proclaimed that Jews needed the blood of Christians In 1235 after the dead bodies of five boys were found on Christmas day in Fulda the inhabitants of the town claimed the Jews had killed them to consume their blood and burned 34 Jews to death with the help of Crusaders assembled at the time Even though emperor Frederick II cleared the Jews of any wrongdoing after an investigation blood libel accusations persisted in Germany At Pforzheim Baden in 1267 a woman supposedly sold a girl to Jews who according to the myth then cut her open and dumped her in the Enz River where boatmen found her the girl cried for vengeance and then died The body was said to have bled as the Jews were brought to it The woman and the Jews allegedly confessed and were subsequently killed That a judicial execution was summarily committed in consequence of the accusation is evident from the manner in which the Nuremberg Memorbuch and the synagogal poems refer to the incident In 1270 at Weissenburg of Alsace a supposed miracle alone decided the charge against the Jews A child s body had shown up in the Lauter River it was claimed that Jews had cut into the child to acquire his blood and that the child continued bleeding for five days At Oberwesel near Easter of 1287 alleged miracles again constituted the only evidence against the Jews In this case it was claimed that the corpse of the 16 year old Werner of Oberwesel also referred to as Good Werner landed at Bacharach and the body performed miracles particularly medicinal miracles Light was also said to have been emitted by the body Reportedly the child was hung upside down forced to throw up the host and was cut open In consequence the Jews of Oberwesel and many other adjacent localities were severely persecuted during the years 1286 89 The Jews of Oberwesel were particularly targeted because there were no Jews remaining in Bacharach following a 1283 pogrom Additionally there were pogroms following this case as well at and around Oberwesel Rudolph of Habsburg to whom the Jews had appealed for protection in order to manage the miracle story had the archbishop of Mainz declare great wrong had been done to the Jew This apparent declaration was very limited in effectiveness A statement was made in the Chronicle of Konrad Justinger of 1423 that at Bern in 1293 or 1294 the Jews tortured and murdered a boy called Rudolph sometimes also referred to as Rudolph Ruff or Ruof The body was reportedly found by the house of J ly a Jew The Jewish community was then implicated The penalties imposed upon the Jews included torture execution expulsion and steep financial fines Justinger argued Jews were out to harm Christianity The historical impossibility of this widely credited story was demonstrated by Jakob Stammler pastor of Bern in 1888 There have been several explanations put forth as to why these blood libel accusations were made and perpetuated For example it has been argued Thomas of Monmouth s account and other similar false accusations as well as their perpetuation largely had to do with the economic and political interests of leaders who did in fact perpetuate these myths Additionally it was largely believed in Europe that Jews used Christian blood for medicinal and other purposes Despite the unsubstantiated mythical nature of these claims as well as their sources they evidently materially impacted the communities in which they

explanation let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the Jewish holy bread In the 2000s a team of Polish anthropologists and sociologists investigated the currency of the blood libel myth in Sandomierz where a painting depicting the blood libel adorns the Cathedral and Orthodox faithful in villages near Bialystok and they discovered that these beliefs persist among some Catholic and Orthodox Christians The fact that local Jews were saved by orders from the bishop who saw them hide in the very same cathedral during the Holocaust gave rise to hopes of transforming Sandomierz into a symbol of hope for the checkered historical Polish Jewish relations In an address that aired on Al Aqsa TV a Hamas run TV station in Gaza on 31

working in a laboratory This doctor lived with a Jewish family One day they said to him We want blood Get us some human blood He was confused He didn t know what this was all about Of course he couldn t betray his work ethics in such a way but he began inquiring and he found that they were making matzos with human blood Al Odeh also stated that Jews eat it believing that this brings them close to their false god Yahweh and that They would lure a child in order to sacrifice him in the religious rite that they perform during that holiday In April 2013 the Palestinian non profit organization MIFTAH founded by Hanan Ashrawi apologized for publishing an article which criticized US President Barack Obama for holding a Passover Seder in the White House by saying Does Obama in fact know the

*: Views of the Catholic Church 

The attitude of the Catholic Church towards these accusations and the cults venerating children supposedly killed by Jews has varied over time The Papacy generally opposed them although it had problems in enforcing its opposition In 1911 the Dictionnaire apolog tique de la foi catholique an important French Catholic encyclopedia published an analysis of the blood libel accusations This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians Other contemporary Catholic sources notably the Jesuit periodical La Civilt Cattolica promoted the blood libel as truth Today the accusations are rarer in Catholic circles While Simon of Trent s local status as a saint was removed in 1965 several towns in Spain still commemorate the blood libel  

**: Papal pronouncements 

Pope Innocent IV took action against the blood libel 5 July 1247 Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel and to prevent the accusation of Arabs on similar charges The Apostolic See and the Jews Documents 492 1404 Simonsohn Shlomo pp 188 189 193 195 208 In 1247 he wrote also that Certain of the clergy and princes nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews unjustly depriving them by force of their property and appropriating it themselves they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy In their malice they ascribe every murder wherever it chance to occur to the Jews And on the ground of these and other fabrications they are filled with rage against them rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation without confession and without legal trial and conviction contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice redress their injuries and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations Pope Gregory X 1271 1276 issued a letter which criticized the practice of blood libels and forbade arrests and persecution of Jews based on a blood libel unless which we do not believe they be caught in the commission of the crime Pope Benedict XIV wrote the bull Beatus Andreas 22 February 1755 in response to an application for the formal canonization of the 15th century Andreas Oxner a folk saint alleged to have been murdered by Jews out of hatred for the Christian faith Benedict did not dispute the claim that Jews murdered Christian children and in anticipating that further cases on this basis would be brought appears to have accepted it as accurate but decreed that in such cases beatification or canonization would be inappropriate  

*: Blood libels in Muslim lands 

In late 1553 or 1554 Suleiman the Magnificent the reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire issued a firman royal decree which formally denounced blood libels against the Jews In 1840 following the Western outrage arising from the Damascus affair British politician and leader of the British Jewish community Sir Moses Montefiore backed by other influential westerners including Britain s Lord Palmerston and Damascus consul Charles Henry Churchill the French lawyer Adolphe Cr mieux Austrian consul Giovanni Gasparo Merlato Danish missionary John Nicolayson and Solomon Munk persuaded Sultan Abdulmejid I in Constantinople to issue a firman on 6 November 1840 intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the Ottoman Empire The edict declared that blood libel accusations were a slander against Jews and they would be prohibited throughout the Ottoman Empire and read in part and for the love we bear to our subjects we cannot permit the Jewish nation whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth In the remainder of the 19th century and into the 20th century there were many instances of the blood libel in Ottoman lands such as the 1881 Fornaraki affair However the libel almost always came from the Christian community sometimes with the connivance of Greek or French diplomats The Jews could usually count on the goodwill of the Ottoman authorities and increasingly on the support of British Prussian and Austrian representatives In the 1910 Shiraz blood libel the Jews of Shiraz Iran were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged with the pogrom leaving 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured In 1983 Mustafa Tlass the Syrian Minister of Defense wrote and published The Matzah of Zion which is a treatment of the Damascus affair of 1840 that repeats the ancient blood libel that Jews use the blood of murdered non Jews in religious rituals such as baking Matza bread In this book he argues that the true religious beliefs of Jews are black hatred against all humans and religions and no Arab country should ever sign a peace treaty with Israel Tlass re printed the book several times Following the book s publication Tlass told Der Spiegel that this accusation against Jews was valid and he also claimed that his book is an historical study based on documents from France Vienna and the American University in Beirut In 2003 the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram published a series of articles by Osama El Baz a senior advisor to the then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Among other things Osama El Baz explained the origins of the blood libel against the Jews He said that Arabs and Muslims have never been antisemitic as a group but he accepted the fact that a few Arab writers and media figures attack Jews on the basis of the racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe He urged people not to succumb to myths such as the blood libel Nevertheless on many occasions in modern times blood libel stories have appeared in the state sponsored media of a number of Arab and Muslim nations as well as on their television shows and websites and books which allege instances of Jewish blood libels are not uncommon there The blood libel was featured in a scene in the Syrian TV series Ash Shatat shown in 2003 In 2007 Lebanese poet Marwan Chamoun in an interview aired on T l Liban referred to the slaughter of the priest Tomaso de Camangiano in 1840 in the presence of two rabbis in the heart of Damascus in the home of a close friend of this priest Daud Al Harari the head of the Jewish community of Damascus After he was slaughtered his blood was collected and the two rabbis took it A novel Death of a Monk based on the Damascus affair was published in 2004

*: History 

 

**: Origins of the first Mellah in Fez (15th century) 

The first Mellah of Morocco was created in the city of Fez Fez had long hosted the largest and one of the oldest Jewish communities in Morocco present since the city s foundation by the Idrisids in the late 8th or early 9th century Since the time of Idris II early 9th century a Jewish community was concentrated in the neighbourhood known as Foundouk el Yihoudi Caravanserai of the Jew near Bab Guissa in the northeast of the city Nonetheless historical evidence also shows that the Jewish population was widely distributed in many parts of the old city Fes el Bali alongside the Muslim population including near the University of al Qarawiyyin in the heart of the city In 1276 the Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd al Haqq founded Fes el Jdid a new fortified administrative city to house their troops and the royal palace The city included a southern district known as Hims which was initially inhabited by Muslim garrisons particularly the Sultan s mercenary contingents of Syrian archers which were later disbanded The same district however was also known by the name Mellah Arabic lit salt or saline area due to either a saline water source in the area or to the presence of a former salt warehouse It was this name which was later retained as the name of the subsequent Jewish quarter in the area Afterwards the name came to be associated by analogy with similar districts that were later created in other cities such as Marrakesh The name mellah thus originally had no negative connotation but was rather just a local toponym Nonetheless over generations a number of legends and popular etymologies came to explain the origin of the word as a salted cursed ground or a place where the Jews were forced to salt the heads of decapitated rebels Both the exact reasons and the exact date for the creation of a separate Jewish Mellah of Fez are not firmly agreed upon by all scholars Historical accounts confirm that in the mid 14th century the Jews of Fez were still living in Fes el Bali but that by the end of the 16th century they were well established in the Mellah of Fes el Jdid Some authors argue that the transfer likely happened in stages across the Marinid period late 13th to 15th centuries particularly following episodes of violence or repression against Jews in the old city The urban fabric of the Mellah appears to have developed progressively and it s possible that a small Jewish population settled here right after the foundation of Fes el Jdid and that other Jews fleeing the old city joined them later Some scholars citing historical Jewish chronicles attribute the date of the move more specifically to the rediscovery of Idris II s body in his zawiya at the center of the old city Fes el Bali in 1437 The surrounding area located in the middle of the city s main commercial districts where Jewish merchants were quite active was turned into a horm sanctuary where non Muslims were not allowed to enter resulting in the expulsion of the Jewish inhabitants and businesses there Many other scholars date the move generally to the mid 15th century In any case the transfer whether progressive or sudden occurred with some violence and hardship Many Jewish households chose to convert at least officially rather than leave their homes and their businesses in the heart of the old city resulting in a growing group referred to as al Baldiyyin Muslim families of Jewish origin often retaining Jewish surnames Broader political motivations for moving the Jewish community to Fes el Jdid closer to the royal palace may have included the rulers desire to take more direct advantage or control of their artisan skills and of their commercial relations with Jewish communities in Europe and other countries which by extension could also be used for diplomatic purposes The Mellah s Jewish cemetery was even established on land which was donated to the Jewish community by a Marinid princess named Lalla Mina in the 15th century The Mellah s location next to the royal palace within the more heavily fortified Fes el Jdid may have also been intended to better protect the Jewish community from the larger and more restive population of the old city a pattern that would be repeated for future mellahs in other cities Despite the more secure location however disasters still occasionally struck the community and its district The 15th century was also a time of relative political instability with the Wattasid viziers taking over effective control from the Marinid dynasty and competing with other local factions in Fez In 1465 the Mellah was attacked by the Muslim population of Fes el Bali during a revolt led by the shurafa noble sharifian families against the Marinid sultan Abd al Haqq II and his Jewish vizier Harun ibn Battash The attack resulted in thousands of Jewish inhabitants being killed with many others having to openly renounce their faith The community took at least a decade to recover from this only growing again under the rule of the Wattasid sultan Muhammad al Shaykh 1472 1505 Major changes in the Jewish population also took place when in 1492 the Spanish crown expelled all Jews from Spain with Portugal doing the same in 1497 The following waves of Spanish Jews migrating to Fez and North Africa increased the Jewish population and also altered its social ethnic and linguistic makeup The influx of migrants also revitalized Jewish cultural activity in the following years while splitting the community along ethnic lines for many generations In Fez for example the Megorashim of Spanish origin retained their heritage and their Spanish language while the indigenous Moroccan Toshavim who spoke Arabic and were of Arab and Berber heritage followed their own traditions Members of the two communities worshiped in separate synagogues and were even buried separately It was only in the 18th century that the two communities eventually blended together with Arabic eventually becoming the main language of the entire community while the Spanish Sephardic minhag became dominant in religious practice a situation which was repeated elsewhere in Morocco with the notable exception of the Marrakesh community 36

For a while the mellah of Fez remained the only one The second mellah was only created in the second half of the 16th century in Marrakesh which by then had replaced Fez as the capital of Morocco under the new Saadian dynasty Here too the Jewish population of the city had lived alongside the Muslim population Many of them had come from the Atlas Mountain regions and from the nearby city of Aghmat where a much older Jewish community had already existed The Jewish district at the time was concentrated in what is now the Mouassine neighbourhood In 1557 58 CE sultan Moulay Abdallah al Ghalib ordered that the Jewish population of the city relocate from here to an area next to the royal Kasbah citadel and construction of the new Mellah of Marrakesh was probably finished around 1562 63 363 364 258 The political motivations for this may have been similar to those of the Marinids in creating the Mellah of Fez which served as a precedent followed by the Saadian dynasty Additionally however Moulay Abdallah appeared to have been planning the creation of new model Muslim neighbourhoods in the city centered around the new Mouassine Mosque which he immediately built on the newly liberated land of the old Jewish neighbourhood Another factor for the move may have been the rapid growth of the Jewish population due to the influx of Jewish migrants from Fez and other towns seeking economic opportunities in the capital Incidentally the new Mellah was indeed quite large and functioned as a city unto itself with its own services and facilities Despite this some historical references indicate that Jews may have still been living in other parts of the city in the decades after the Mellah s creation A Frenchman who was held captive in Morocco from 1670 to 1681 wrote In Fez and in Morocco that is Marrakesh the Jews are separated from the inhabitants having their own quarters set apart surrounded by walls of which the gates are guarded by men appointed by the King In the other towns they are intermingled with the Moors In 1791 a European traveller described the Marrakesh mellah It has two large gates which are regularly shut every evening about nine o clock after which time no person whatever is permitted to enter or go out till the following morning The Jews have a market of their own The third mellah of Morocco wasn t created until 1682 when the Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma il moved the Jewish population of Meknes his new capital to a new district on the southwest side of the city next to the vast new royal citadel that he was building for himself there 234 In Fez the 17th century saw a significant influx of Jews from the Tadla region and from the Sous Valley arriving under the reigns of the Alaouite sultans Moulay Rashid and Moulay Isma il respectively A serious disaster however took place in 1790 to 1792 during a period of general turmoil for the city under Sultan Moulay Yazid During these two years the sultan forced the entire Jewish community to move to the outlying Kasbah Cherarda on the other side of Fes el Jdid The Mellah was occupied by tribal troops allied to him its synagogue was replaced by a mosque and the Jewish cemetery and its contents were moved to a cemetery near Bab Guissa Moreover Moulay Yazid permanently reduced the size of the district by demolishing the old city walls around it and rebuilding them along a much smaller perimeter It was only after the sultan s death that the chief Muslim qadi judge of Fez ordered the Mellah to be restored to the Jewish community along with the demolition of the mosque built by Yazid s troops

At the beginning of the 19th century around 1807 sultan Sulayman forced Jews to move to mellahs in the towns of the coastal region in Rabat Sal Essaouira and Tetouan In Tetouan the Spanish word juder a was later used as the name of the district The mellah in Rabat was established in 1808 by Sultan Mawlay Sulaiman this separated the Jewish and Muslim people who had lived together in a shared area of the city In Sal the new Jewish quarter was a long avenue with a total of 200 houses 20 shops and trading booths two kilns and two mills In 1865 the mellah of Essaouira having become over populated was permitted to extend During this century the fortunes of the Jewish community of Fez in particular improved considerably as the expansion of contact and trade with Europe allowed the Jewish merchant class to place themselves at the center of international trade networks in Morocco This also led to a greater social openness and a shift in tastes and attitudes especially among richer Jews who built luxurious residences in the upper parts of the Mellah there  

**: 20th century onwards 

In the early twentieth century affluent Jews started to move to the new neighborhoods Villes nouvelles planned along European urban schemes leaving in the mellahs only the elderly and the poorest families Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 almost all Moroccan Jews for a variety of reasons have emigrated either to the new Jewish state or to countries like France and Canada some in government coordinated programs such as Operation Yachin 165 some fleeing persecution some for religious reasons and some encouraged by the Jewish Agency As a result nowadays mellahs are only inhabited by Muslims the few remaining Jews have moved to modern quarters of Moroccan towns The changing economy of Morocco has also meant that the majority of Moroccan Jews now live in the modern metropolis of Casablanca with an estimated 5 000 living there in 1997 with only 150 living in Fez by comparison In Marrakesh parts of the mellah are showing signs of the gentrification in the 21st century Only three Jewish families remain in the Mellah with one of them taking care of the Slat al Azama Synagogue one of the few remaining in the area The Mellah of Fez faces a similar fate however it is currently undergoing renovation thanks to UNESCO funding The legacy of the Moroccan Jewish districts on commerce remain as the markets constructed and brought alive by Jewish merchants not only exist as of 2014 but still in the lively forms they served in previous centuries for the Jewish communities The former mellahs continue to be visited as historical sites One writer notes The quarters squalor still exists but they re also picturesque and bustling and that too speaks to Morocco s vibrant Jewish past  

*: Culture 

While the settling location of Jews was by Muslim rulers was typically imposed the mellah existed in a relatively autonomous fashion with Jews building and sustaining their own communities within the walls of their quarter Indeed there was resistance to forced relocation but ultimately the Jewish mellah became a sanctified space that the Jews had pride for The one gate that gave way to the medina which could have easily been repudiated as an emblem of imprisonment instead came to be treated as an object of reverence by the mellah s inhabitants as we see in this description from the early twentieth century If one stops for a moment in front of this gate one sees a curious thing All who pass children beggars peddlers driving their donkeys loaded with merchandise old women hunched over men all approach this dusty wall and press their lips against it with as much fervor as if they were kissing the holy Torah 34 The mellahs of Morocco primarily came about as Jews migrated to Morocco after being expelled from the Iberian Peninsula during the Spanish Inquisition There were two primary justifications given for mellahization First these Jewish quarters were often in close proximity to the ruling local powers offering a form of protection for the Jews This explanation also addresses the resulting effective authority over differing religious populations if all the Jews are physically together it is easier to maintain effective muslim rule assess taxes and keep count of the community The second justification of cause for the institution of the mellah is the idea that mellahs were a collective punishment for specific transgressions Jews were associated with ethical deviance physical malformation and disease and so were separated from the Christian and Muslim populations 21 Organization relative to the city as a whole gives insight into how Jews were situated compared to the Muslim majority and how relevant these justifications are to specific mellahs As Gilson Miller et al write Sometimes the quarter is contained within the larger city and forms a microcosm of it such as the Jewish quarter of Tetuan at other times it is removed from the molecular city and attached to the royal enclave as in Fez The siting of the quarter invites speculation about its origins and the relationship between the Jewish minority and the Muslim majority Was the purpose of the quarter to isolate its inhabitants to safeguard them or both In Fez the proximity of the mellah to the royal palace is often read as a sign of dependency of the Jews on the power and protection of the ruling sovereign 311 

*: Physical space and cultural interaction 

Mellahs walled on all four sides and typically gated housed the Jewish population of Moroccan cities As a result these spaces fostered Jewish communal life through its physical structures Mellahs were typically organized in neighborhoods and had synagogues a Jewish cemetery and kosher markets situated among other public areas Even the synagogue itself facilitated a wide variety of Jewish communal needs including education ritual baths and spaces for children to play 35 36 While at first these quarters offered considerable comfort to Jewish families with spacious homes and protection due to proximity to the royal palace these luxuries soon came to a close Yet over time the quarters narrow streets became congested and overrun with people and they became synonymous with ghettos The Jews were confined to the inner walls of the rundown mellahs and the areas became associated with cursed salted land much like the Jews were perceived among Moroccan society As Jews were key players in trade and commerce mellahs were often situated on major waterways and were usually pretty close to each other to facilitate trade networks effectively Even more so the mellah s market became a prominent space for not only the Jewish community but non Jewish peoples who would come to shop on market days Because Jews commonly held merchant and artisan positions the mellah was an attractive trade post for the entire city not just the Jewish quarter 73 Separation certainly stifled cultural interaction to some degree but Muslims were allowed to enter the mellah and did so if they needed goods and services that fell within the Jewish niche 323

*: Cover Art Archive 

MusicBrainz allows contributors to upload cover art images of releases to the database these images are hosted by Cover Art Archive CAA a joint project between Internet Archive and MusicBrainz started in 2012 Internet Archive provides the bandwidth storage and legal protection for hosting the images while MusicBrainz stores metadata and provides public access through the Web and via an API for third parties to use As with other contributions the MusicBrainz community is in charge of maintaining and reviewing the data Until May 16 2022 cover art was also provided for items on sale at Amazon com and some other online resources but CAA is now preferred because it gives the community more control and flexibility for managing the images As of October 2023 over 4 6 million images exist in the archive  

*: Fingerprinting 

Besides collecting metadata about music MusicBrainz also allows looking up recordings by their acoustic fingerprint A separate application such as MusicBrainz Picard is used to do this  

**: Proprietary services 

In 2000 MusicBrainz started using Relatable s patented TRM a recursive acronym for TRM Recognizes Music for acoustic fingerprint matching This feature attracted many users and allowed the database to grow quickly However by 2005 TRM was showing scalability issues as the number of tracks in the database had reached the millions This issue was resolved in May 2006 when MusicBrainz partnered with MusicIP now AmpliFIND replacing TRM with MusicDNS TRMs were phased out and replaced by MusicDNS in November 2008 In October 2009 MusicIP was acquired by AmpliFIND Sometime after the acquisition the MusicDNS service began having intermittent problems  

**: AcoustID and Chromaprint 

Since the future of the free identification service was uncertain a replacement for it was sought The Chromaprint acoustic fingerprinting algorithm the basis for AcoustID identification service was started in February 2010 by a long time MusicBrainz contributor Luk Lalinsk While AcoustID and Chromaprint are not officially MusicBrainz projects they are closely tied with each other and both are open source Chromaprint works by analyzing the first two minutes of a track detecting the strength in each of 12 pitch classes storing these eight times per second Additional post processing is then applied to compress this fingerprint while retaining patterns The AcoustID search server then searches from the database of fingerprints by similarity and returns the AcoustID identifier along with MusicBrainz recording identifiers if known  

*: Licensing 

Since 2003 MusicBrainz s core data artists recordings releases and so on are in the public domain and additional content including moderation data essentially every original content contributed by users and its elaborations is placed under the Creative Commons CC BY NC SA 2 0 license The relational database management system is PostgreSQL The server software is covered by the GNU General Public License The MusicBrainz client software library libmusicbrainz is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License which allows use of the code by proprietary software products In December 2004 the MusicBrainz project was turned over to the MetaBrainz Foundation a non profit group by its creator Robert Kaye On 20 January 2006 the first commercial venture to use MusicBrainz data was the Barcelona Spain based Linkara in their Linkara M sica service On 28 June 2007 BBC announced that it had licensed MusicBrainz s live data feed to augment their music web pages The BBC online music editors would also join the MusicBrainz community to contribute their knowledge to the database On 28 July 2008 the beta of the new BBC Music site was launched which publishes a page for each MusicBrainz artist  

*: ListenBrainz 

ListenBrainz is a free and open source project that aims to crowdsource listening data from digital music and release it under an open license It is a MetaBrainz Foundation project tied to MusicBrainz It aims to re implement Last fm features that were lost following that platform s acquisition by CBS ListenBrainz takes submissions from media players and services such as Music Player Daemon Spotify and Rhythmbox in the form of listens ListenBrainz can also import Last fm and Libre fm scrobbles in order to build listening history As listens are released under an open license ListenBrainz is useful for music research for industry and development purposes ListenBrainz can also generate recommendations and playlists based on individual listening In December 2021 the Year in Music reports feature was added allowing users to find out and share their top tracks albums and artists for the year

*: Presentation 

The links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of in vision continuity using presenters to interact with the children In the UK links are recorded rather than broadcast live as is the case on sister channel CBBC They were originally recorded from studio TC0 at BBC Television Centre in London but moved out in 2008 to Teddington Studios and returned briefly in 2010 From September 2011 onwards the links have been based at the BBC s northern base at studios HQ5 and HQ6 in Dock10 studios at MediaCityUK following the move of the BBC Children s department there International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base As is with the rest of the BBC s channels there is a lack of advertisements and programmes are occasionally broken up by trailers for new shows new seasons of said shows or events  

**: Logo and identities 

CBeebies uses many identities throughout the day during the breaks in between shows Most of these idents feature the mascots named the Bugs also known as the Bugbies The Bugbies are yellow blobs with faces and are similar to the ones used by CBBC between 2002 and 2005 with the only difference being the colour green for CBBC and yellow for CBeebies with both using purple as a similarity Most idents before the late 2010 s feature children saying the channel name twice once the logo appears except the Bedtime idents The idents have used a moving blobby slimy like background or rounded shapes in any colour Each block has its own ident and the Bedtime Hour has a few different idents In 2016 new idents were made for each block replacing the old ones and the slimy moving background idents were rarely shown Idents featuring the CBeebies House with it changing to effect the current season have been used from 2016 to 2023 On 15 March 2023 CBeebies underwent a rebranding by Blue Zoo to fully adopt the BBC s new corporate branding with the Bugs reimagined in a rounded square shaped form to evoke the BBC logo and a new suite of idents and animated scenes incorporating two and three dimensional elements
