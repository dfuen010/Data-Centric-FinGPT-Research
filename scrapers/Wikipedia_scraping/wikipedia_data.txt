[<p><b><a href="/wiki/George_Griffith" title="George Griffith">George Griffith</a></b> (1857–1906) was a British writer. He was active mainly in the <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> genre, writing many <a href="/wiki/Invasion_literature" title="Invasion literature">future-war</a> stories and helping to shape that emerging subgenre. He was briefly the leading science fiction author in Britain, making his breakthrough with his debut novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Angel_of_the_Revolution" title="The Angel of the Revolution">The Angel of the Revolution</a></i> (1893), which was first serialized in <i><a href="/wiki/Pearson%27s_Weekly" title="Pearson's Weekly">Pearson's Weekly</a></i>. He followed it up with the likewise successful sequel <i><a href="/wiki/Olga_Romanoff" title="Olga Romanoff">Olga Romanoff</a></i> (1894). Griffith was highly active as a writer throughout the 1890s, penning many short works for <a href="/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Pearson,_1st_Baronet" title="Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet">C. Arthur Pearson</a>, and went on travel assignments. These included an 1896 trip to <a href="/wiki/Southern_Africa" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a> that resulted in Griffith writing the novel <i>Briton or Boer?</i> (1897), anticipating the <a href="/wiki/Second_Boer_War" title="Second Boer War">Boer War</a> (1899–1902). Griffith's career declined in the late 1890s, and he was surpassed by <a href="/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a> in the eyes of Pearson and the reading public. His last outright success was <i><a href="/wiki/A_Honeymoon_in_Space" title="A Honeymoon in Space">A Honeymoon in Space</a></i> (1901).
