        "text": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets Whereas banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards the Basel Accords Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world In the history of banking a number of banking dynasties notably the Medicis the Fuggers the Welsers the Berenbergs and the Rothschilds have played a central role over many centuries The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena founded in 1472 while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank founded in 1590 History Banking as an archaic activity or quasi banking is thought to have begun as early as the end of the 4th millennium BCE to the 3rd millennia BCE Medieval The present era of banking can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance Italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like Florence Lucca Siena Venice and Genoa The Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in 14th century Florence establishing branches in many other parts of Europe Giovanni di Bicci de Medici set up one of the most famous Italian banks the Medici Bank in 1397 The Republic of Genoa founded the earliest known state deposit bank and Banco di San Giorgio Bank of St George in 1407 at Genoa Italy Early modern Fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries Merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London who possessed private vaults and who charged a fee for that service In exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods Gradually the goldsmiths began to lend money out on behalf of the depositor and promissory notes which evolved into banknotes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith Thus by the 19th century we find in ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations or bankers the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum and the bank is to restore not the same money but an equivalent sum whenever it is demanded and money when paid into a bank ceases altogether to be the money of the principal see Parker v Marchant 1 Phillips 360 it is then the money of the banker who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it The goldsmith paid interest on deposits Since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances loans to the goldsmith s customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith s promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default Thus the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit The Bank of England originated the permanent issue of banknotes in 1695 The Royal Bank of Scotland established the first overdraft facility in 1728 By the beginning of the 19th century Lubbock s Bank had established a bankers clearing house in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions The Rothschilds pioneered international finance on a large scale financing the purchase of shares in the Suez canal for the British government in 1875 Etymology The word bank was taken into Middle English from Middle French banque from Old Italian banco meaning table from Old High German banc bank bench counter Benches were used as makeshift desks or exchange counters during the Renaissance by Florentine bankers who used to make their transactions atop desks covered by green tablecloths Definition The definition of a bank varies from country to country See the relevant country pages for more information Under English common law a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking by conducting current accounts for their customers paying cheques drawn on them and also collecting cheques for their customers In most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments including cheques and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term banker banker includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not who carry on the business of banking Section 2 Interpretation Although this definition seems circular it is actually functional because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated The business of banking is in many common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general In particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking However in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one Examples of statutory definitions banking business means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers the making of advances to customers and includes such other business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act Banking Act Singapore Section 2 Interpretation banking business means the business of either or both of the following receiving from the general public money on current deposit savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than 3 months or with a period of call or notice of less than that period paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers Since the advent of EFTPOS Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale direct credit direct debit and internet banking the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties even if they do not pay and collect cheques Standard business Banks act as payment agents by conducting checking or current accounts for customers paying cheques drawn by customers in the bank and collecting cheques deposited to customers current accounts Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as Automated Clearing House ACH Wire transfers or telegraphic transfer EFTPOS and automated teller machines ATMs Banks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts by accepting term deposits and by issuing debt securities such as banknotes and bonds Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts by making installment loans and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending Banks provide different payment services and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals Non banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account Banks issue new money when they make loans In contemporary banking systems regulators set a minimum level of reserve funds that banks must hold against the deposit liabilities created by the funding of these loans in order to ensure that the banks can meet demands for payment of such deposits These reserves can be acquired through the acceptance of new deposits sale of other assets or borrowing from other banks including the central bank Range of activities Activities undertaken by banks include personal banking corporate banking investment banking private banking transaction banking insurance consumer finance trade finance and other related Channels Banks offer many different channels to access their banking and other services Branch in person banking in a retail location Automated teller machine banking adjacent to or remote from the bank Bank by mail Most banks accept cheque deposits via mail and use mail to communicate to their customers Online banking over the Internet to perform multiple types of transactions Mobile banking is using one s mobile phone to conduct banking transactions Telephone banking allows customers to conduct transactions over the telephone with an automated attendant or when requested with a telephone operator Video banking performs banking transactions or professional banking consultations via a remote video and audio connection Video banking can be performed via purpose built banking transaction machines similar to an Automated teller machine or via a video conference enabled bank branch clarification Relationship manager mostly for private banking or business banking who visits customers at their homes or businesses Direct Selling Agent who works for the bank based on a contract whose main job is to increase the customer base for the bank Business models A bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice Traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customers The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities This difference is referred to as the spread between the cost of funds and the loan interest rate Historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance In the past 20 years American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions First this includes the Gramm Leach Bliley Act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses Merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for one stop shopping by enabling cross selling of products which the banks hope will also increase profitability Second they have expanded the use of risk based pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans This helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit Third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients These products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems it is still common to deal strictly in cash including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home However with the convenience of easy credit there is also an increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt Banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to credit and debit card holders and transaction fees to retailers who accept the bank s cards for payments This helps in making a profit and facilitates economic development as a whole Recently as banks have been faced with pressure from fintechs new and additional business models have been suggested such as freemium monetisation of data white labeling of banking and payment applications or the cross selling of complementary products Products Retail ATM card

services lock box remote deposit capture merchant processing Credit services Securities Services Capital and risk Banks face a number of risks in order to conduct their business and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability and how much capital a bank is required to hold Bank capital consists principally of equity retained earnings and subordinated debt Some of the main risks faced by banks include Credit risk risk of loss arising from a borrower who does not make payments as promised Liquidity risk risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss or make the required profit Market risk risk that the value of a portfolio either an investment portfolio or a trading portfolio will decrease due to the change in value of the market risk factors Operational risk risk arising from the execution of a company s business functions Reputational risk a type of risk related to the trustworthiness of the business Macroeconomic risk risks related to the aggregate economy the bank is operating in The capital requirement is a bank regulation which sets a framework within which a bank or depository institution must manage its balance sheet The categorisation of assets and capital is highly standardised so that it can be risk weighted After the financial crisis of 2007 2008 regulators force banks to issue Contingent convertible bonds CoCos These are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses in accordance with their contractual terms when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level Then debt is reduced and bank capitalisation gets a boost Owing to their capacity to absorb losses CoCos have the potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirement Banks in the economy Economic functions The economic functions of banks include Issue of money in the form of banknotes and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customer s order These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par They are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash Netting and settlement of payments banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments This enables banks to economise on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them Credit quality improvement banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers ordinary credit quality but are high quality borrowers The improvement comes from diversification of the bank s assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations However banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position Asset liability mismatch Maturity transformation banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans In other words they borrow short and lend long With a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues e g accepting deposits and issuing banknotes and redemptions e g withdrawals and redemption of banknotes maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources e g wholesale cash markets and securities markets Money creation destruction whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractional reserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed Bank crisis Banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises These include liquidity risk where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds credit risk the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it and interest rate risk the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans Banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for the banking sector as a whole Prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the Great Depression the U S Savings and Loan crisis in the 1980s and early 1990s the Japanese banking crisis during the 1990s and the sub prime mortgage crisis in the 2000s The 2023 global banking crisis is the latest of these crises In March 2023 liquidity shortages and bank insolvencies led to three bank failures in the United States and within two weeks several of the world s largest banks failed or were shut down by regulators Size of global banking industry Assets of the largest 1 000 banks in the world grew by 6 8 in the 2008 2009 financial year to a record US 96 4 trillion while profits declined by 85 to US 115 billion Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of recapitalisation EU banks held the largest share of the total 56 in 2008 2009 down from 61 in the previous year Asian banks share increased from 12 to 14 during the year while the share of US banks increased from 11 to 13 Fee revenue generated by global investment in banking totalled US 66 3 billion in 2009 up 12 on the previous year The United States has the most banks in the world in terms of institutions 5 330 as of 2015 and possibly branches 81 607 as of 2015 This is an indicator of the geography and regulatory structure of the US resulting in a large number of small to medium sized institutions in its banking system As of November 2009 China s top four banks have in excess of 67 000 branches ICBC 18000 BOC 12000 CCB 13000 ABC 24000 with an additional 140 smaller banks with an undetermined number of branches Japan had 129 banks and 12 000 branches In 2004 Germany France and Italy each had more than 30 000 branches more than double the 15 000 branches in the United Kingdom Mergers and acquisitions Between 1985 and 2018 banks engaged in around 28 798 mergers or acquisitions either as the acquirer or the target company The overall known value of these deals cumulates to around 5 169 bil USD In terms of value there have been two major waves 1999 and 2007 which both peaked at around 460 bil USD followed by a steep decline 82 from 2007 until 2018 Here is a list of the largest deals in history in terms of value with participation from at least one bank Regulation Currently commercial banks are regulated in most jurisdictions by government entities and require a special bank license to operate Usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits even if they are not repayable to the customer s order although money lending by itself is generally not included in the definition Unlike most other regulated industries the regulator is typically also a participant in the market being either publicly or privately governed central bank Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes However in some countries this is not the case In the UK for example the Financial Services Authority licenses banks and some commercial banks such as the Bank of Scotland issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the Bank of England the UK government s central bank Banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank defined above and the customer defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account The law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows The bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank The bank agrees to pay the customer s checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customer s account plus any agreed overdraft limit The bank may not pay from the customer s account without a mandate from the customer e g a cheque drawn by the customer The bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customer s account as the customer s agent and to credit the proceeds to the customer s account And the bank has a right to combine the customer s accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship The bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customer s account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank The bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer s account unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the bank s interests require it or the law demands it The bank must not close a customer s account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days These implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms or create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bank customer relationship Some types of financial institutions such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules The requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include Minimum capital Minimum capital ratio Fit and Proper requirements for the bank s controllers owners directors or senior officers Approval of the bank s business plan as being sufficiently prudent and plausible Different types of banking Banks activities can be divided into retail banking dealing directly with individuals and small businesses business banking providing services to mid market business corporate banking directed at large business entities private banking providing wealth management services to high net worth individuals and families investment banking relating to activities on the financial markets Most banks are profit making private enterprises However some are owned by the government or are non profit organisations Types of banks Commercial banks the term used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank After the Great Depression the U S Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities whereas investment banks were limited to capital market activities Since the two no longer have to be under separate ownership some use the term commercial bank to refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses Community banks locally operated financial institutions that empower employees to make local decisions to serve their customers and partners Community development banks regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under served markets or populations Land development banks The special banks providing long term loans are called land development banks LDB The history of LDB is quite old The first LDB was started at Jhang in Punjab in 1920 The main objective of the LDBs is to promote the development of land agriculture and increase the agricultural production The LDBs provide long term finance to members directly through their branches Credit unions or co operative banks not for profit cooperatives owned by the depositors and often offering rates more favourable than for profit banks Typically membership is restricted to employees of a particular company residents of a defined area members of a certain union or religious organisations and their immediate families Postal savings banks savings banks associated with national postal systems Private banks banks that manage the assets of high net worth individuals Historically a minimum of US 1 million was required to open an account however over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to US 350 000 for private investors Offshore banks banks located in jurisdictions with low taxation and regulation Many offshore banks are essentially private banks Savings banks in Europe savings banks took their roots in the 19th or sometimes even in the 18th century Their original objective was to provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the population In some countries savings banks were created on public initiative in others socially committed individuals created foundations to put in place the necessary infrastructure Nowadays European savings banks have kept their focus on retail banking payments savings products credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium sized enterprises Apart from this retail focus they also differ from commercial banks by their broadly decentralised distribution network providing local and regional outreach and by their socially responsible approach to business and society Ethical banks banks that prioritize the transparency of all operations and make only what they consider to be socially responsible investments A direct or internet only bank is a banking operation without any physical bank branches Transactions are usually accomplished using ATMs and electronic transfers and direct deposits through an online interface Types of investment banks Investment banks underwrite guarantee the sale of stock and bond issues provide investment management and advise corporations on capital market activities such as M A trade for their own accounts make markets provide securities services to institutional clients Merchant banks were traditionally banks which engaged in trade finance The modern definition however refers to banks which provide capital to firms in the form of shares rather than loans Unlike venture caps they tend not to invest in new companies Combination banks Universal banks more commonly known as financial services companies engage in several of these activities These big banks are very diversified groups that among other services also distribute insurance hence the term bancassurance a portmanteau word combining banque or bank and assurance signifying that both banking and insurance are provided by the same corporate entity Other types of banks Central banks are normally government owned and charged with quasi regulatory responsibilities such as supervising commercial banks or controlling the cash interest rate They generally provide liquidity to the banking system and act as the lender of last resort in event of a crisis Islamic banks adhere to the concepts of Islamic law This form of banking revolves around several well established principles based on Islamic laws All banking activities must avoid interest a concept that is forbidden in Islam Instead the bank earns profit markup and fees on the financing facilities that it extends to customers Challenges within the banking industry United States The United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialised and focused regulators All banks with FDIC insured deposits have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC as a regulator However for soundness examinations i e whether a bank is operating in a sound manner the Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Fed member state banks the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC is the primary federal regulator for national banks State non member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC 236 National banks have one primary regulator the OCC Each regulatory agency has its own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council FFIEC was established in 1979 as a formal inter agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing In addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve FDIC OTS and OCC Offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut The remaining regulators face an increased burden with an increased workload and more banks per regulator While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands on assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States The changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders The management of the banks asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today s economic environment Loans are a bank s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core While always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions There are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of good times The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management Problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered In addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs Banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups Across the country many banks management teams and boards of directors are ageing Banks also face ongoing pressure from shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk Banking is also an extremely competitive industry Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies credit unions cheque cashing services credit card companies etc As a reaction banks have developed their activities in financial instruments through financial market operations such as brokerage and have become big players in such activities Another major challenge is the ageing infrastructure also called legacy IT Backend systems were built decades ago and are incompatible with new applications Fixing bugs and creating interfaces costs huge sums as knowledgeable programmers become scarce Loan activities of banks To be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed banks must compete for deposits The phenomenon of disintermediation had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as U S Department of Treasury obligations agency securities and corporate debt One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits To compete for deposits US savings institutions offer many different types of plans Passbook or ordinary deposit accounts permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time NOW and Super NOW accounts function like checking accounts but earn interest A minimum balance may be required on Super NOW accounts Money market accounts carry a monthly limit of preauthorised transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance Certificate accounts subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity Notice accounts the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term Savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal Individual retirement accounts IRAs and Keogh plans a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal Checking accounts offered by some institutions under definite restrictions All withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner unless the parent or guardian is required to do otherwise for legal reasons Club accounts and other savings accounts designed to help people save regularly to meet certain goals Types of accounts Bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world Under GAAP there are two kinds of accounts debit and credit Credit accounts are Revenue Equity and Liabilities Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses The bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance The customer debits his or her savings bank asset account in his ledger when making a deposit and the account is normally in debit while the customer credits a credit card liability account in his ledger every time he spends money and the account is normally in credit When the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement If the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement Brokered deposits One source of deposits for banks is deposit brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or hot money as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank Such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits There are different types of accounts saving recurring and current accounts Custodial accounts Custodial accounts are accounts in which assets are held for a third party For example businesses that accept custody of funds for clients prior to their conversion return or transfer may have a custodial account at a bank for these purposes Globalisation in the banking industry In modern times there have been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as Bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk The growth in cross border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities Despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross border activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalised as some other industries In the US for instance very few banks even worry about the Riegle Neal Act which promotes more efficient interstate banking In the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation One reason the banking industry has not been fully globalised is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small businesses and individuals On the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporation s financial information is available around the globe See also

                "text": "In modern times there have been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as Bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk The growth in cross border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities Despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross border activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalised as some other industries In the US for instance very few banks even worry about the Riegle Neal Act which promotes more efficient interstate banking In the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation One reason the banking industry has not been fully globalised is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small businesses and individuals On the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporation s financial information is available around the globe ",

        "text": "English law is the common law legal system of England and Wales comprising mainly criminal law and civil law each branch having its own courts and procedures Principal elements of English law Although the common law has historically been the foundation and prime source of English law the most authoritative law is statutory legislation which comprises Acts of Parliament regulations and by laws In the absence of any statutory law the common law with its principle of stare decisis forms the residual source of law based on judicial decisions custom and usage Common law is made by sitting judges who apply both statutory law and established principles which are derived from the reasoning from earlier decisions Equity is the other historic source of judge made law Common law can be amended or repealed by Parliament Not being a civil law system it has no comprehensive codification However most of its criminal law has been codified from its common law origins in the interests both of certainty and of ease of prosecution For the time being murder remains a common law crime rather than a statutory offence Although Scotland and Northern Ireland form part of the United Kingdom and share Westminster as a primary legislature they have separate legal systems outside English law International treaties such as the European Union s Treaty of Rome or the Hague Visby Rules have effect in English law only when adopted and ratified by Act of Parliament Adopted treaties may be subsequently denounced by executive action unless the denouncement or withdraw would affect rights enacted by Parliament In this case executive action cannot be used owing to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty This principle was established in the case of R Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union in 2017 Legal terminology Criminal law and civil law Criminal law is the law of crime and punishment whereby the Crown prosecutes the accused Civil law is concerned with tort contract families companies and so on Civil law courts operate to provide a party who has an enforceable claim against another party with a remedy such as damages or a declaration Common law and civil law In this context civil law is the system of codified law that is prevalent in Europe Civil law is founded on the ideas of Roman law By contrast English law is the archetypal common law jurisdiction built upon case law Common law and equity In this context common law means the judge made law of the King s Bench whereas equity is the judge made law of the now defunct Court of Chancery Equity is concerned mainly with trusts and equitable remedies Equity generally operates in accordance with the principles known as the maxims of equity The reforming Judicature Acts of the 1880s amalgamated the courts into one Supreme Court of Judicature which was directed to administer both law and equity The neo gothic Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand London were built shortly afterwards to celebrate these reforms Public law and private law Public law is the law governing relationships between individuals and the state Private law encompasses relationships between private individuals and other private entities but may also cover private relationships between the government and private entities Legal remedies A remedy is the means given by law for the recovery of a right or of compensation for its infringement Most remedies are available only from the court but some are self help remedies for instance a party who lawfully wishes to cancel a contract may do so without leave and a person may take his own steps to abate a private nuisance Formerly most civil actions claiming damages in the High Court were commenced by obtaining a writ issued in the Queen s name After 1979 writs have merely required the parties to appear and writs are no longer issued in the name of the Crown After the Woolf Reforms of 1999 almost all civil actions other than those connected with insolvency are commenced by the completion of a Claim Form as opposed to a writ originating application or a summons Sources of English law In England there is a hierarchy of sources as follows Legislation primary and secondary The case law rules of common law and equity derived from precedent decisions Parliamentary conventions General customs Books of authorityThe rule of European Union law in England previously of prime importance has been ended as a result of Brexit Statute law Primary legislation in the UK may take the following forms Acts of Parliament Acts of the Scottish Parliament Acts of the Senedd or previously Acts of the National Assembly for Wales and measures of the National Assembly for Wales Statutory rules of the Northern Ireland AssemblyOrders in Council are a sui generis category of legislation Secondary or delegated legislation in England includes Statutory instruments and ministerial orders By laws of metropolitan boroughs county councils and town councilsStatutes are cited in this fashion Short Title Year e g Theft Act 1968 This became the usual way to refer to Acts from 1840 onwards previously Acts were cited by their long title with the regnal year of the parliamentary session when they received royal assent and the chapter number For example the Pleading in English Act 1362 which required pleadings to be in English and not Law French was referred to as 36 Edw 3 c 15 meaning 36th year of the reign of Edward III chapter 15 By contrast American convention inserts of as in Civil Rights Act of 1964 Common law Common law is a term with historical origins in the legal system of England It denotes in the first place the Anglo Norman legal system that superseded and replaced Anglo Saxon law in England following the Battle of Hastings in 1066 Throughout the Late Medieval Period English law was codified through judge made laws and precedents that were created in the proceedings of Royal justices in the Circuit courts dictated by the Eyres throughout the country these themselves evolving from the early medieval Itinerant courts This body of legal scholarship was first published at the end of the 19th century The History of English Law before the Time of Edward I in which Pollock and Maitland expanded the work of Coke 17th century and Blackstone 18th century Specifically the law developed in England s Court of Common Pleas and other common law courts which became also the law of the colonies settled initially under the Crown of England or later of the United Kingdom in North America and elsewhere This law further developed after those courts in England were reorganised by the Supreme Court of Judicature Acts passed in the 1870s It developed independently in the legal systems of the United States and other jurisdictions after their independence from the United Kingdom before and after the 1870s The term is used in the second place to denote the law developed by those courts in the same periods pre colonial colonial and post colonial as distinct from within the jurisdiction or former jurisdiction of other courts in England the Court of Chancery the ecclesiastical courts and the Admiralty court In the Oxford English Dictionary 1933 common law is described as The unwritten law of England administered by the King s courts which purports to be derived from ancient usage and is embodied in the older commentaries and the reports of abridged cases as opposed in that sense to statute law and as distinguished from the equity administered by the Chancery and similar courts and from other systems such as ecclesiastical law and admiralty law For usage in the United States the description is the body of legal doctrine which is the foundation of the law administered in all states settled from England and those formed by later settlement or division from them Possible Islamic Origins Professor John Makdisi s article The Islamic Origins of the Common Law in the North Carolina Law Review theorised that English common law was influenced by medieval Islamic law Makdisi drew comparisons between the royal English contract protected by the action of debt and the Islamic Aqd the English assize of novel disseisin a petty assize adopted in the 1166 at the Assizes of Clarendon and the Islamic Istihqaq and the English jury and the Islamic Lafif in the classical Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence He argued that these institutions were transmitted to England by the Normans through the close connection between the Norman kingdoms of Roger II in Sicily ruling over a conquered Islamic administration and Henry II in England Makdisi argued that the law schools known as Inns of Court in England which he asserts are parallel to Madrasahs may have also originated from Islamic law He states that the methodology of legal precedent and reasoning by analogy Qiyas are similar in both the Islamic and common law systems Other legal scholars such as Monica Gaudiosi Gamal Moursi Badr and A Hudson have argued that the English trust and agency institutions which were introduced by Crusaders may have been adapted from the Islamic Waqf and Hawala institutions they came across in the Middle East Paul Brand notes parallels between the Waqf and the trusts used to establish Merton College by Walter de Merton who had connections with the Knights Templar Early development In 1276 the concept of time immemorial often applied in common law was defined as being any time before 6 July 1189 i e before Richard I s accession to the English throne Since 1189 English law has been a common law not a civil law system In other words no comprehensive codification of the law has taken place and judicial precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive This may be a legacy of the Norman conquest of England when a number of legal concepts and institutions from Norman law were introduced to England In the early centuries of English common law the justices and judges were responsible for adapting the system of writs to meet everyday needs applying a mixture of precedent and common sense to build up a body of internally consistent law An example is the Law Merchant derived from the Pie Powder Courts named from a corruption of the French pieds poudr s dusty feet implying ad hoc marketplace courts Following Montesquieu s theory of the separation of powers only Parliament has the power to legislate If a statute is ambiguous then the courts have exclusive power to decide its true meaning using the principles of statutory interpretation Since the courts have no authority to legislate the legal fiction is that they declare rather than create the common law The House of Lords took this declaratory power a stage further in DPP v Shaw where in creating the new crime of conspiracy to corrupt public morals Viscount Simonds claimed the court had a residual power to protect the moral welfare of the state As Parliament became ever more established and influential Parliamentary legislation gradually overtook judicial law making such that today s judges are able to innovate only in certain very narrowly defined areas Overseas influences Reciprocity England exported its common law and statute law to most parts of the British Empire Many aspects of that system have survived after Independence from British rule and the influences are often reciprocal English law prior to the American Revolutionary Wars American War of Independence is still an influence on United States law and provides the basis for many American legal traditions and principles After independence English common law still exerted influence over American common law for example Byrne v Boadle 1863 which first applied the res ipsa loquitur doctrine Jurisdictions that have kept to the common law may incorporate modern legal developments from England and English decisions are usually persuasive in such jurisdictions In the United States each state has its own supreme court with final appellate jurisdiction resulting in the development of state common law The US Supreme Court has the final say over federal matters By contrast in Australia one national common law exists Courts of final appeal After Britain s colonial period jurisdictions that had inherited and adopted England s common law developed their courts of final appeal in differing ways jurisdictions still under the British crown are subject to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London For a long period the British Dominions used London s Privy Council as their final appeal court although one by one they eventually established their local supreme court New Zealand was the last Dominion to abandon the Privy Council setting up its own Supreme Court in 2004 Even after independence many former British colonies in the Commonwealth continued to use the Privy Council as it offered a readily available high grade service In particular several Caribbean Island nations found the Privy Council advantageous International law and commerce Britain is a dualist in its relationship with international law so international treaties must be formally ratified by Parliament and incorporated into statute before such supranational laws become binding in the UK Britain has long been a major trading nation exerting a strong influence on the law of shipping and maritime trade The English law of salvage collisions ship arrest and carriage of goods by sea are subject to international conventions which Britain played a leading role in drafting Many of these conventions incorporate principles derived from English common law and documentary procedures British jurisdictions The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland comprises three legal jurisdictions England and Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland Although Scotland and Northern Ireland form part of the United Kingdom and share the Parliament at Westminster as the primary legislature they have separate legal systems Scotland became part of the UK over 300 years ago but Scots law has remained remarkably distinct from English law The UK s highest civil appeal court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom whose decisions and those of its predecessor the House of Lords are binding on all three UK jurisdictions Unless obviously limited to a principle of distinct English and Welsh Scottish or Northern Irish law as in Donoghue v Stevenson a Scots case that forms the basis of the UK s law of negligence Application of English law to Wales Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland Wales is not a separate jurisdiction within the United Kingdom The customary laws of Wales within the Kingdom of England were abolished by King Henry VIII s Laws in Wales Acts which brought Wales into legal conformity with England While Wales now has a devolved parliament the Senedd any legislation it passes must adhere to circumscribed subjects under the Government of Wales Act 2006 to other legislation of the British Parliament or to any Order in Council given under the authority of the 2006 Act Any reference to England in legislation between 1746 and 1967 is deemed to include Wales As to later legislation any application to Wales must be expressed under the Welsh Language Act 1967 and the jurisdiction is since correctly and widely referred to as England and Wales Devolution has granted some political autonomy to Wales via the National Assembly for Wales which gained its power to pass primary legislation under the Government of Wales Act 2006 in force since the 2007 Welsh general election The legal system administered through civil and criminal courts is unified throughout England and Wales This is different from Northern Ireland for example which did not cease to be a distinct jurisdiction when its legislature was suspended see Northern Ireland Temporary Provisions Act 1972 A major difference is use of the Welsh language as laws concerning it apply in Wales and not in the rest of the United Kingdom The Welsh Language Act 1993 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which put the Welsh language on an equal footing with the English language in Wales with regard to the public sector Welsh may also be spoken in Welsh courts There have been calls from both Welsh academics and politicians for a separate Welsh justice system Classes of English law See also

    "Law of the United States": {
        "text": "The law of the United States comprises many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law of which the most important is the nation s Constitution which prescribes the foundation of the federal government of the United States as well as various civil liberties The Constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law which consists of Acts of Congress treaties ratified by the Senate regulations promulgated by the executive branch and case law originating from the federal judiciary The United States Code is the official compilation and codification of general and permanent federal statutory law Federal law and treaties so long as they are in accordance with the Constitution preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 U S states and in the territories However the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal In the dual sovereign system of American federalism actually tripartite because of the presence of Indian reservations states are the plenary sovereigns each with their own constitution while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the Constitution Indeed states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal Constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights Thus U S law especially the actual living law of contract tort property criminal and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day to day basis consists primarily of state law which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next At both the federal and state levels with the exception of the legal system of Louisiana the law of the United States is largely derived from the common law system of English law which was in force in British America at the time of the American Revolutionary War However American law has diverged greatly from its English ancestor both in terms of substance and procedure and has incorporated a number of civil law innovations General overview Sources of law In the United States the law is derived from five sources constitutional law statutory law treaties administrative regulations and the common law which includes case law Constitutionality Where Congress enacts a statute that conflicts with the Constitution state or federal courts may rule that law to be unconstitutional and declare it invalid Notably a statute does not automatically disappear merely because it has been found unconstitutional it may however be deleted by a subsequent statute Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional However under the principle of stare decisis no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court Conversely any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases will risk reversal by the Supreme Court American common law The United States and most Commonwealth countries are heirs to the common law legal tradition of English law Certain practices traditionally allowed under English common law were expressly outlawed by the Constitution such as bills of attainder and general search warrants As common law courts U S courts have inherited the principle of stare decisis American judges like common law judges elsewhere not only apply the law they also make the law to the extent that their decisions in the cases before them become precedent for decisions in future cases The actual substance of English law was formally received into the United States in several ways First all U S states except Louisiana have enacted reception statutes which generally state that the common law of England particularly judge made law is the law of the state to the extent that it is not repugnant to domestic law or indigenous conditions Some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date for reception such as the date of a colony s founding while others are deliberately vague Thus contemporary U S courts often cite pre Revolution cases when discussing the evolution of an ancient judge made common law principle into its modern form such as the heightened duty of care traditionally imposed upon common carriers Second a small number of important British statutes in effect at the time of the Revolution have been independently reenacted by U S states Two examples are the Statute of Frauds still widely known in the U S by that name and the Statute of 13 Elizabeth the ancestor of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act Such English statutes are still regularly cited in contemporary American cases interpreting their modern American descendants Despite the presence of reception statutes much of contemporary American common law has diverged significantly from English common law Although the courts of the various Commonwealth nations are often influenced by each other s rulings American courts rarely follow post Revolution precedents from England or the British Commonwealth Early on American courts even after the Revolution often did cite contemporary English cases because appellate decisions from many American courts were not regularly reported until the mid 19th century Lawyers and judges used English legal materials to fill the gap Citations to English decisions gradually disappeared during the 19th century as American courts developed their own principles to resolve the legal problems of the American people The number of published volumes of American reports soared from eighteen in 1810 to over 8 000 by 1910 By 1879 one of the delegates to the California constitutional convention was already complaining Now when we require them to state the reasons for a decision we do not mean they shall write a hundred pages of detail We do not mean that they shall include the small cases and impose on the country all this fine judicial literature for the Lord knows we have got enough of that already Today in the words of Stanford law professor Lawrence M Friedman American cases rarely cite foreign materials Courts occasionally cite a British classic or two a famous old case or a nod to Blackstone but current British law almost never gets any mention Foreign law has never been cited as binding precedent but as a reflection of the shared values of Anglo American civilization or even Western civilization in general Levels of law Federal law Federal law originates with the Constitution which gives Congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating interstate commerce The United States Code is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes Many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations which are published in the Federal Register and codified into the Code of Federal Regulations Regulations generally also carry the force of law under the Chevron doctrine Many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis During the 18th and 19th centuries federal law traditionally focused on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal government in the federal Constitution like the military money foreign relations especially international treaties tariffs intellectual property specifically patents and copyrights and mail Since the start of the 20th century broad interpretations of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like aviation telecommunications railroads pharmaceuticals antitrust and trademarks In some areas like aviation and railroads the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law while in others like family law a relatively small number of federal statutes generally covering interstate and international situations interacts with a much larger body of state law In areas like antitrust trademark and employment law there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other In a handful of areas like insurance Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them see e g the McCarran Ferguson Act Statutes After the president signs a bill into law or Congress enacts it over the president s veto it is delivered to the Office of the Federal Register OFR of the National Archives and Records Administration NARA where it is assigned a law number and prepared for publication as a slip law Public laws but not private laws are also given legal statutory citation by the OFR At the end of each session of Congress the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the United States Statutes at Large and they are known as session laws The Statutes at Large present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that they have been enacted Public laws are incorporated into the United States Code which is a codification of all general and permanent laws of the United States The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives and cumulative supplements are published annually The U S Code is arranged by subject matter and it shows the present status of laws with amendments already incorporated in the text that have been amended on one or more occasions Regulations Congress often enacts statutes that grant broad rulemaking authority to federal agencies Often Congress is simply too gridlocked to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation or Congress believes the agency s technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise Therefore federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations Under the principle of Chevron deference regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes Regulations are adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act APA Regulations are first proposed and published in the Federal Register FR or Fed Reg and subject to a public comment period Eventually after a period for public comment and revisions based on comments received a final version is published in the Federal Register The regulations are codified and incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations CFR which is published once a year on a rolling schedule Besides regulations formally promulgated under the APA federal agencies also frequently promulgate an enormous amount of forms manuals policy statements letters and rulings These documents may be considered by a court as persuasive authority as to how a particular statute or regulation may be interpreted known as Skidmore deference but are not entitled to Chevron deference Common law case law and precedent Unlike the situation with the states there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their English predecessors Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts However it is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States by vesting judicial power into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent this power was widely accepted understood and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified Several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide cases or controversies necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies The difficult question is whether federal judicial power extends to formulating binding precedent through strict adherence to the rule of stare decisis This is where the act of deciding a case becomes a limited form of lawmaking in itself in that an appellate court s rulings will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases and therefore also implicitly binds all persons within the court s jurisdiction Prior to a major change to federal court rules in 2007 about one fifth of federal appellate cases were published and thereby became binding precedents while the rest were unpublished and bound only the parties to each case As federal judge Alex Kozinski has pointed out binding precedent as we know it today simply did not exist at the time the Constitution was framed Judicial decisions were not consistently accurately and faithfully reported on both sides of the Atlantic reporters often simply rewrote or failed to publish decisions which they disliked and the United Kingdom lacked a coherent court hierarchy prior to the end of the 19th century Furthermore English judges in the eighteenth century subscribed to now obsolete natural law theories of law by which law was believed to have an existence independent of what individual judges said Judges saw themselves as merely declaring the law which had always theoretically existed and not as making the law Therefore a judge could reject another judge s opinion as simply an incorrect statement of the law in the way that scientists regularly reject each other s conclusions as incorrect statements of the laws of science In turn according to Kozinski s analysis the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U S in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy under the Judiciary Acts and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U S appellate decisions by West Publishing The rule gradually developed case by case as an extension of the judiciary s public policy of effective judicial administration that is in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power The rule of binding precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy first as a matter of fundamental fairness and second because in the absence of case law it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed argued and decided from first principles such as relevant statutes constitutional provisions and underlying public policies which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency instability and unpredictability and thereby undermine the rule of law The contemporary form of the rule is descended from Justice Louis Brandeis s landmark dissent in 1932 s Burnet v Coronado Oil Gas Co which catalogued the Court s actual overruling practices in such a powerful manner that his attendant stare decisis analysis immediately assumed canonical authority Here is a typical exposition of how public policy supports the rule of binding precedent in a 2008 majority opinion signed by Justice Breyer Justice Brandeis once observed that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right Burnet v Coronado Oil Gas Co To overturn a decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe that decision is no longer right would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others And that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption confusion and uncertainty for necessary legal stability We have not found here any factors that might overcome these considerations It is now sometimes possible over time for a line of precedents to drift from the express language of any underlying statutory or constitutional texts until the courts decisions establish doctrines that were not considered by the texts drafters This trend has been strongly evident in federal substantive due process and Commerce Clause decisions Originalists and political conservatives such as Associate Justice Antonin Scalia have criticized this trend as anti democratic Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co v Tompkins 1938 there is no general federal common law Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision statute or regulation which was either enacted as part of the Constitution or pursuant to constitutional authority Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law Only in a few narrow limited areas like maritime law has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit subject to the limitations of stare decisis The other major implication of the Erie doctrine is that federal courts cannot dictate the content of state law when there is no federal issue and thus no federal supremacy issue in a case When hearing claims under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction federal trial courts must apply the statutory and decisional law of the state in which they sit as if they were a court of that state even if they believe that the relevant state law is irrational or just bad public policy Under Erie such federal deference to state law applies only in one direction state courts are not bound by federal interpretations of state law Similarly state courts are also not bound by most federal interpretations of federal law In the vast majority of state courts interpretations of federal law from federal courts of appeals and district courts can be cited as persuasive authority but state courts are not bound by those interpretations The U S Supreme Court has never squarely addressed the issue but has signaled in dicta that it sides with this rule Therefore in those states there is only one federal court that binds all state courts as to the interpretation of federal law and the federal Constitution the U S Supreme Court itself State and territory law The fifty American states are separate sovereigns with their own state constitutions state governments and state courts All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization and a judicial branch that applies interprets and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations as well as local ordinances They retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution federal statutes or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate Normally state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue in which case a decision may be appealed to the U S Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control but must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law family law property law contract law criminal law and so on Most cases are litigated in state courts and involve claims and defenses under state laws In a 2018 report the National Center for State Courts Court Statistics Project found that state trial courts received 83 8 million newly filed cases in 2018 which consisted of 44 4 million traffic cases 17 0 million criminal cases 16 4 million civil cases 4 7 million domestic relations cases and 1 2 million juvenile cases In 2018 state appellate courts received 234 000 new cases By way of comparison all federal district courts in 2016 together received only about 274 552 new civil cases 79 787 new criminal cases and 833 515 bankruptcy cases while federal appellate courts received 53 649 new cases State legal systems Territorial legal systems Local law States have delegated lawmaking powers to thousands of agencies townships counties cities and special districts And all the state constitutions statutes and regulations as well as all the ordinances and regulations promulgated by local entities are subject to judicial interpretation like their federal counterparts It is common for residents of major U S metropolitan areas to live under six or more layers of special districts as well as a town or city and a county or township in addition to the federal and state governments Thus at any given time the average American citizen is subject to the rules and regulations of several dozen different agencies at the federal state and local levels depending upon one s current location and behavior Legal subjects American lawyers draw a fundamental distinction between procedural law which controls the procedure by which legal rights and duties are vindicated and substantive law the actual substance of law which is usually expressed in the form of various legal rights and duties Criminal law and procedure Criminal law involves the prosecution by the state of wrongful acts which are considered to be so serious that they are a breach of the sovereign s peace and cannot be deterred or remedied by mere lawsuits between private parties Generally crimes can result in incarceration but torts see below cannot The majority of the crimes committed in the United States are prosecuted and punished at the state level Federal criminal law focuses on areas specifically relevant to the federal government like evading payment of federal income tax mail theft or physical attacks on federal officials as well as interstate crimes like drug trafficking and wire fraud All states have somewhat similar laws in regard to higher crimes or felonies such as murder and rape although penalties for these crimes may vary from state to state Capital punishment is permitted in some states but not others Three strikes laws in certain states impose harsh penalties on repeat offenders Some states distinguish between two levels felonies and misdemeanors minor crimes Generally most felony convictions result in lengthy prison sentences as well as subsequent probation large fines and orders to pay restitution directly to victims while misdemeanors may lead to a year or less in jail and a substantial fine To simplify the prosecution of traffic violations and other relatively minor crimes some states have added a third level infractions These may result in fines and sometimes the loss of one s driver s license but no jail time On average only three percent of criminal cases are resolved by jury trial 97 percent are terminated either by plea bargaining or dismissal of the charges For public welfare offenses where the state is punishing merely risky as opposed to injurious behavior there is significant diversity across the various states For example punishments for drunk driving varied greatly prior to 1990 State laws dealing with drug crimes still vary widely with some states treating possession of small amounts of drugs as a misdemeanor offense or as a medical issue and others categorizing the same offense as a serious felony The law of criminal procedure in the United States consists of a massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems as well as the proceedings in criminal trials Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U S to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights In turn the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers of which the most famous is the Miranda warning The writ of habeas corpus is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention while the Third Enforcement Act and Bivens actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality Civil procedure The law of civil procedure governs process in all judicial proceedings involving lawsuits between private parties Traditional common law pleading was replaced by code pleading in 27 states after New York enacted the Field Code in 1850 and code pleading in turn was subsequently replaced again in most states by modern notice pleading during the 20th century The old English division between common law and equity courts was abolished in the federal courts by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938 it has also been independently abolished by legislative acts in nearly all states The Delaware Court of Chancery is the most prominent of the small number of remaining equity courts Thirty five states have adopted rules of civil procedure modeled after the FRCP including rule numbers However in doing so they had to make some modifications to account for the fact that state courts have broad general jurisdiction while federal courts have relatively limited jurisdiction New York Illinois and California are the most significant states that have not adopted the FRCP Furthermore all three states continue to maintain most of their civil procedure laws in the form of codified statutes enacted by the state legislature as opposed to court rules promulgated by the state supreme court on the ground that the latter are undemocratic But certain key portions of their civil procedure laws have been modified by their legislatures to bring them closer to federal civil procedure Generally American civil procedure has several notable features including extensive pretrial discovery heavy reliance on live testimony obtained at deposition or elicited in front of a jury and aggressive pretrial law and motion practice designed to result in a pretrial disposition that is summary judgment or a settlement U S courts pioneered the concept of the opt out class action by which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish to be bound by the judgment as opposed to opt in class actions where class members must join into the class Another unique feature is the so called American Rule under which parties generally bear their own attorneys fees as opposed to the English Rule of loser pays though American legislators and courts have carved out numerous exceptions Contract law Contract law covers obligations established by agreement express or implied between private parties Generally contract law in transactions involving the sale of goods has become highly standardized nationwide as a result of the widespread adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code However there is still significant diversity in the interpretation of other kinds of contracts depending upon the extent to which a given state has codified its common law of contracts or adopted portions of the Restatement Second of Contracts Parties are permitted to agree to arbitrate disputes arising from their contracts Under the Federal Arbitration Act which has been interpreted to cover all contracts arising under federal or state law arbitration clauses are generally enforceable unless the party resisting arbitration can show unconscionability or fraud or something else which undermines the entire contract Tort law Tort law generally covers any civil action between private parties arising from wrongful acts which amount to a breach of general obligations imposed by law and not by contract This broad family of civil wrongs involves interference with person property reputation or commercial or social advantage Tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can inflict upon each other and partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable by criminal law It is primarily a matter of state law and is usually developed through case law from state appellate courts it is rarely a matter of federal law and tort related statutes are focused on discrete issues like authorizing wrongful death claims which did not exist at common law Although the American Law Institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the Restatement of Torts many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the Restatements and to reject others Thus because of its immense size and diversity American tort law cannot be easily summarized For example a few jurisdictions allow actions for negligent infliction of emotional distress even in the absence of physical injury to the plaintiff but most do not For any particular tort states differ on the causes of action types and scope of remedies statutes of limitations and the amount of specificity with which one must plead the cause With practically any aspect of tort law there is a majority rule adhered to by most states and one or more minority rules Notably the most broadly influential innovation of 20th century American tort law was the rule of strict liability for defective products which originated with judicial glosses on the law of warranty In 1963 Roger J Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v Yuba Power Products The American Law Institute subsequently adopted a slightly different version of the Greenman rule in Section 402A of the Restatement Second of Torts which was published in 1964 and was very influential throughout the United States Outside the U S the rule was adopted by the European Economic Community in the Product Liability Directive of July 1985 by Australia in July 1992 and by Japan in June 1994 By the 1990s the avalanche of American cases resulting from Greenman and Section 402A had become so complicated that another restatement was needed which occurred with the 1997 publication of the Restatement Third of Torts Products Liability Property law Historically American property law has been heavily influenced by English land law and is therefore concerned with real property first and personal property second It is also primarily a matter of state law and the level of interstate diversity in the law of property is much more substantial than in contract and tort Efforts by both the American Law Institute and the Uniform Law Commission to reduce such interstate diversity were spectacular failures The majority of states use a title recording system coupled with privately provided title insurance to manage title to real property although title registration Torrens title is also allowed in a small minority of states Title to personal property is usually not registered with the notable exceptions of motor vehicles through a state department of motor vehicles or equivalent bicycles in certain cities and counties and some types of firearms in certain states Family law In the United States family law governs relationships between adults and relationships between parents and their children As a discrete area of law worthy of its own specialists and law professors American family law is relatively young in comparison to European family law it did not take flight until the no fault divorce revolution of the 1960s Before the 1950s widespread religious legal and social prohibitions against divorce in the United States meant that divorces were rare were often seen as fact driven matters meaning that they were perceived as turning on each case s facts and not broadly generalizable legal principles and rarely went up on appeal The rise of no fault divorce caused divorce litigation to shift away from the question of who was at fault for the collapse of the marital relationship and to focus instead on issues such as division of property spousal support and child support Family cases are traditionally a matter of state law and are virtually always heard only in state courts Certain kinds of contract tort and property civil actions involving state law issues can be heard in federal courts under diversity jurisdiction but federal courts decline to hear family cases under the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction Although family cases are heard in state courts

                                "text": "Unlike the situation with the states there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their English predecessors Federal courts are solely creatures of the federal Constitution and the federal Judiciary Acts However it is universally accepted that the Founding Fathers of the United States by vesting judicial power into the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts in Article Three of the United States Constitution thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent this power was widely accepted understood and recognized by the Founding Fathers at the time the Constitution was ratified Several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide cases or controversies necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies The difficult question is whether federal judicial power extends to formulating binding precedent through strict adherence to the rule of stare decisis This is where the act of deciding a case becomes a limited form of lawmaking in itself in that an appellate court s rulings will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases and therefore also implicitly binds all persons within the court s jurisdiction Prior to a major change to federal court rules in 2007 about one fifth of federal appellate cases were published and thereby became binding precedents while the rest were unpublished and bound only the parties to each case As federal judge Alex Kozinski has pointed out binding precedent as we know it today simply did not exist at the time the Constitution was framed Judicial decisions were not consistently accurately and faithfully reported on both sides of the Atlantic reporters often simply rewrote or failed to publish decisions which they disliked and the United Kingdom lacked a coherent court hierarchy prior to the end of the 19th century Furthermore English judges in the eighteenth century subscribed to now obsolete natural law theories of law by which law was believed to have an existence independent of what individual judges said Judges saw themselves as merely declaring the law which had always theoretically existed and not as making the law Therefore a judge could reject another judge s opinion as simply an incorrect statement of the law in the way that scientists regularly reject each other s conclusions as incorrect statements of the laws of science In turn according to Kozinski s analysis the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U S in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy under the Judiciary Acts and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U S appellate decisions by West Publishing The rule gradually developed case by case as an extension of the judiciary s public policy of effective judicial administration that is in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power The rule of binding precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy first as a matter of fundamental fairness and second because in the absence of case law it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed argued and decided from first principles such as relevant statutes constitutional provisions and underlying public policies which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency instability and unpredictability and thereby undermine the rule of law The contemporary form of the rule is descended from Justice Louis Brandeis s landmark dissent in 1932 s Burnet v Coronado Oil Gas Co which catalogued the Court s actual overruling practices in such a powerful manner that his attendant stare decisis analysis immediately assumed canonical authority Here is a typical exposition of how public policy supports the rule of binding precedent in a 2008 majority opinion signed by Justice Breyer Justice Brandeis once observed that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right Burnet v Coronado Oil Gas Co To overturn a decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe that decision is no longer right would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others And that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption confusion and uncertainty for necessary legal stability We have not found here any factors that might overcome these considerations It is now sometimes possible over time for a line of precedents to drift from the express language of any underlying statutory or constitutional texts until the courts decisions establish doctrines that were not considered by the texts drafters This trend has been strongly evident in federal substantive due process and Commerce Clause decisions Originalists and political conservatives such as Associate Justice Antonin Scalia have criticized this trend as anti democratic Under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co v Tompkins 1938 there is no general federal common law Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision statute or regulation which was either enacted as part of the Constitution or pursuant to constitutional authority Federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law Only in a few narrow limited areas like maritime law has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit subject to the limitations of stare decisis The other major implication of the Erie doctrine is that federal courts cannot dictate the content of state law when there is no federal issue and thus no federal supremacy issue in a case When hearing claims under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction federal trial courts must apply the statutory and decisional law of the state in which they sit as if they were a court of that state even if they believe that the relevant state law is irrational or just bad public policy Under Erie such federal deference to state law applies only in one direction state courts are not bound by federal interpretations of state law Similarly state courts are also not bound by most federal interpretations of federal law In the vast majority of state courts interpretations of federal law from federal courts of appeals and district courts can be cited as persuasive authority but state courts are not bound by those interpretations The U S Supreme Court has never squarely addressed the issue but has signaled in dicta that it sides with this rule Therefore in those states there is only one federal court that binds all state courts as to the interpretation of federal law and the federal Constitution the U S Supreme Court itself ",

        "text": "The history of the United States from 1815 to 1849 was the period of westward expansion in America The spread of democracy opened the ballot box to nearly all white men allowing the Jacksonian democracy to dominate politics during the Second Party System Whigs representing wealthier planters merchants financiers and professionals wanted to modernize the society using tariffs and federally funded internal improvements they were blocked by the Jacksonians who closed down the national bank in the 1830s The Jacksonians wanted expansion known as Manifest destiny into new lands that would be occupied by farmers and planters Thanks to the annexation of Texas the defeat of Mexico in war and a compromise with Britain the western third of the nation rounded out the continental United States by 1848 The transformation of America underwent was not so much political democratization but rather the explosive growth of technologies and networks of infrastructure and communication including with the telegraph railroads the post office and an expanding print industry They made possible the religious revivals of the Second Great Awakening the expansion of education and social reform They modernized party politics and sped up business by enabling the fast efficient movement of goods money and people across an expanding nation They transformed a loose knit collection of parochial agricultural communities into a powerful cosmopolitan nation Economic modernization proceeded rapidly thanks to highly profitable cotton crops in the South new textile and machine making industries in the Northeast and a fast developing transportation infrastructure Breaking loose from European models the Americans developed their own high culture notably in literature and in higher education The Second Great Awakening brought revivals across the country forming new denominations and greatly increasing church membership especially among Methodists and Baptists By the 1840s increasing numbers of immigrants were arriving from Europe especially British Irish and Germans Many settled in the cities which were starting to emerge as a major factor in the economy and society The Whigs had warned that annexation of Texas would lead to a crisis over slavery and they were proven right by the turmoil of the 1850s that led to the Civil War Era of Good Feelings and the rise of Nationalism After the War of 1812 the United States began to assert a newfound sense of nationalism America began to rally around national heroes like Andrew Jackson Patriotic feelings were aroused by Francis Scott Key s poem The Star Spangled Banner Under the direction of Chief Justice John Marshall the Supreme Court issued a series of opinions reinforcing the role of the national government These decisions included McCulloch v Maryland and Gibbons v Ogden both of which reaffirmed the supremacy of the national government over the states The signing of the Adams On s Treaty helped settle the western border of the country through popular and peaceable means Sectionalism Even as nationalism increased across the country its effects were limited by a renewed sense of sectionalism The New England states that had opposed the War of 1812 felt an increasing decline in political power with the demise of the Federalist Party This loss was tempered with the arrival of a new industrial movement and increased demands for northern banking The Industrial Revolution in the United States was advanced by the immigration of Samuel Slater from Great Britain and arrival of textile mills beginning in Lowell Massachusetts In the south the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney radically increased the value of slave labor The export of southern cotton was now the predominant export of the U S The western states continued to thrive under the frontier spirit Individualism was prized as exemplified by Davey Crockett and James Fenimore Cooper s folk hero Natty Bumppo from The Leatherstocking Tales Following the death of Tecumseh in 1813 Native Americans lacked the unity to stop white settlement Era of Good Feelings Domestically the presidency of James Monroe 1817 1825 was hailed at the time and since as the Era of Good Feelings because of the decline of partisan politics and heated rhetoric after the war The Federalist Party collapsed but without an opponent the Democratic Republican Party decayed as sectional interests came to the fore The Monroe Doctrine was drafted by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams in collaboration with the British and proclaimed by Monroe in late 1823 He asserted the Americas should be free from additional European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries affairs It further stated the United States intention to stay neutral in wars between European powers and their colonies but to consider any new colonies or interference with independent countries in the Americas as hostile acts towards the United States No new colonies were ever formed Annexation of Florida and border treaties As the 19th century dawned Florida had been undisputed Spanish territory for almost 250 years aside from 20 years of British control between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution Although a sparsely inhabited swampland expansionist minded Americans were eager to grab it and already in 1808 American settlers had invaded the westernmost tip of Florida and expelled the local Spanish authorities after which Congress hastily passed a bill annexing it under the claim that the Louisiana Purchase had guaranteed the territory to the United States During the War of 1812 American troops occupied and seized the area around Mobile Bay Spain then engulfed in war with France did not react to either of these actions Also taking advantage of the mother country s distraction Spain s Latin American colonies rose up in revolt and Madrid was forced to denude Florida of troops to suppress the rebellions As the Spanish withdrew Native American and pirate raids from Florida to the US increased In 1818 Andrew Jackson led an army into Florida to quell the chaotic situation there He arrested and hanged two British agents who had been encouraging Indian raids leading to an outcry in London and calls for war However cooler heads prevailed and the situation did not escalate further A year later Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the Adams On s Treaty with Spain The Spanish agreed to turn over the no longer defensible Florida to the US and also give up their extremely flimsy claims to the distant Oregon Territory in exchange for which American claims on Texas were renounced some Americans had also been claiming parts of that territory under the Louisiana Purchase The heretofore vague border between the US and Spanish North America was also settled upon Although American designs on Texas did not disappear they were put on the backburner for the more immediately important Florida Meanwhile in 1818 the U S and Britain also agreed to settle the western border with Canada which was established at the 49th parallel running straight from the Great Lakes to the Rocky Mountains Included in this settlement was the headwaters of the Red River in what would eventually become Minnesota and the Mesabi Range which eventually proved to contain vast amounts of iron ore The eastern border of Canada continued to be disputed and was not settled until 1845 Emergence of Second Party System Monroe was re elected without opposition in 1820 and the old caucus system for selecting Republican candidates soon collapsed into factions In the presidential election of 1824 factions in Tennessee and Pennsylvania put forth Andrew Jackson From Kentucky came Speaker of the House Henry Clay while Massachusetts produced Secretary of State Adams a rump congressional caucus put forward Treasury Secretary William H Crawford Personality and sectional allegiance played important roles in determining the outcome of the election Adams won the electoral votes from New England and most of New York Clay won his western base of Kentucky Ohio and Missouri Jackson won his base in the Southeast and plus Illinois Indiana North Carolina South Carolina Pennsylvania Maryland and New Jersey and Crawford won his base in the South Virginia Georgia and Delaware No candidate gained a majority in the Electoral College so the president was selected by the House of Representatives where Clay was the most influential figure In return for Clay s support in winning the presidency John Quincy Adams appointed Clay as secretary of state in what Jacksonians denounced as The Corrupt bargain During Adams administration new party alignments appeared Adams followers took the name of National Republicans to reflect the mainstream of Jeffersonian Republicanism Elected with less than 35 of the popular vote Adams was a minority president and his cold aloof personality did not win many friends Adams was also a poor politician and alienated potential political allies with his commitment to principles when he refused to remove Federal officeholders and replace them with supporters out of patronage A strong nationalist he called for the construction of national road networks and canals and renewed George Washington s call for a national academy Adams even went so far as to suggest the construction of astronomical observatories to rival those of Europe These extravagant proposals offended many average Americans Southerners in particular opposed them because they would require continued heavy tariffs and they feared government overreach of this type could easily lead to action taken against slavery Adams had little to boast about in domestic affairs Despite his sterling career in foreign affairs Adams also proved less than successful at foreign policy His old rival British Foreign Secretary George Canning played a cat and mouse game with him Ever since the Treaty of Paris 42 years earlier Britain had barred American merchantmen from doing business in its islands in the West Indies although smugglers frequently evaded this ban When Adams demanded that London open the islands to trade Canning rejected his request Another fiasco for the president occurred when the newly independent Latin American republics held a congress in Panama in 1826 Adams requested permission and funding from Congress to send two delegates Some Congressmen worried about becoming involved in foreign entanglements while Southerners sensitive to racial issues disliked the idea of granting recognition and equal status to the black and mixed Latin American states Although Adams was ultimately successful in getting approval one of the two delegates died en route to Panama and the Panama Congress ultimately accomplished little of value Jacksonian democracy The charismatic Andrew Jackson collaborated with Martin Van Buren to rally his followers in the newly formed Democratic Party In the election of 1828 Jackson defeated Adams by an overwhelming electoral majority in the first presidential election since 1800 to mark a wholesale voter rejection of the previous administration s policies The electoral campaign was correspondingly as vicious as the one 28 years earlier with Jackson and Adams camps hurtling the worst mudslinging accusations at one another The former painted himself as a war hero and the champion of the masses against Northeastern elites while the latter argued that he was a man of education and social grace against an uncouth semi literate backwoodsman This belied the fact that Andrew Jackson was a societal elite by any definition owning a large plantation with dozens of slaves and mostly surrounding himself with men of wealth and property The election saw the coming to power of Jacksonian democracy thus marking the transition from the First Party System which reflected Jeffersonian democracy to the Second Party System Historians debate the significance of the election with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics with the decisive establishment of democracy and the formation of the two party system When Jackson took office on March 4 1829 many doubted if he would survive his term in office A week short of his 63rd birthday he was the oldest man yet elected president and suffering from the effects of old battle wounds He also had a frequent hacking cough and sometimes spit up blood The inauguration ball became a notorious event in the history of the American presidency as a large mob of guests swarmed through the White House tracking dirt and mud everywhere and consuming a giant cheese that had been presented as an inaugural gift to the president A contemporary journalist described the spectacle as the reign of King Mob Suffrage of all white men Starting in the 1820s American politics became more democratic as many state and local offices went from being appointed to elective and the old requirements for voters to own property were abolished Voice voting in states gave way to ballots printed by the parties and by the 1830s presidential electors were chosen directly by the voters in all states except South Carolina Jacksonian democracy drew its support from the small farmers of the West and the workers artisans and small merchants of the East They favored geographical expansion to create more farms for people like them and distrusted the upper classes who envisioned an industrial nation built on finance and manufacturing The entrepreneurs for whom Henry Clay and Daniel Webster were heroes fought back and formed the Whig party Political machines appeared early in the history of the United States and for all the exhortations of Jacksonian Democracy it was they and not the average voter that nominated candidates In addition the system supported establishment politicians and party loyalists and much of the legislation was designed to reward men and businesses who supported a particular party or candidate As a consequence the chance of single issue and ideology based candidates being elected to major office dwindled and so those parties who were successful were pragmatist ones which appealed to multiple constituencies Single issue parties included the Anti Masonic Party which emerged in the Northeastern states Its goal was to outlaw Freemasonry as a violation of republicanism its members were energized by reports that a man who threatened to expose Masonic secrets had been murdered They ran a candidate for president William Wirt in 1832 he won 8 of the popular vote nationwide carried Vermont and ran well in rural Pennsylvania and Massachusetts The party then merged into the new Whig Party Others included abolitionist parties workers parties like the Workingmen s Party the Locofocos who opposed monopolies and assorted nativist parties who denounced the Roman Catholic Church as a threat to Republicanism in the United States None of these parties were capable of mounting a broad enough appeal to voters or winning major elections The election of 1828 was a significant benchmark marking the climax of the trend toward broader voter eligibility and participation Vermont had universal male suffrage since its entry into the Union and Tennessee permitted suffrage for the vast majority of taxpayers New Jersey Maryland and South Carolina all abolished property and tax paying requirements between 1807 and 1810 States entering the Union after 1815 either had universal white male suffrage or a low taxpaying requirement From 1815 to 1821 Connecticut Massachusetts and New York abolished all property requirements In 1824 members of the Electoral College were still selected by six state legislatures By 1828 presidential electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but Delaware and South Carolina Nothing dramatized this democratic sentiment more than the election of Andrew Jackson In addition the 1828 election marked the decisive emergence of the West as a major political bloc and an end to the dominance of the original 13 states on national affairs Indian removal In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Indian tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River In 1834 a special Indian Territory was established in what is now the eastern part of Oklahoma In all Native American tribes signed 94 treaties during Jackson s two terms ceding thousands of square miles to the Federal government The Cherokees insisted on their independence from state government authority and faced expulsion from their lands when a faction of Cherokees signed the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 obtaining money in exchange for their land Despite protests from the elected Cherokee government and many white supporters the Cherokees were forced to trek to the Indian Territory in 1838 Many died of disease and privation in the Trail of Tears Nullification crisis Toward the end of his first term Jackson was forced to confront the state of South Carolina on the issue of the protective tariff The protective tariff passed by Congress and signed into law by Jackson in 1832 was milder than that of 1828 but it further embittered many in the state In response several South Carolina citizens endorsed the states rights principle of nullification which was enunciated by John C Calhoun Jackson s vice president until 1832 in his South Carolina Exposition and Protest 1828 South Carolina dealt with the tariff by adopting the Ordinance of Nullification which declared both the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832 null and void within state borders Nullification was only the most recent in a series of state challenges to the authority of the federal government In response to South Carolina s threat Jackson sent seven small naval vessels and a man of war to Charleston in November 1832 On December 10 he issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers South Carolina the President declared stood on the brink of insurrection and treason and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought Senator Henry Clay though an advocate of protection and a political rival of Jackson piloted a compromise measure through Congress Clay s 1833 compromise tariff specified that all duties more than 20 of the value of the goods imported were to be reduced by easy stages so that by 1842 the duties on all articles would reach the level of the moderate tariff of 1816 The rest of the South declared South Carolina s course unwise and unconstitutional Eventually South Carolina rescinded its action Jackson had committed the federal government to the principle of Union supremacy South Carolina however had obtained many of the demands it sought and had demonstrated that a single state could force its will on Congress Banking Even before the nullification issue had been settled another controversy arose to challenge Jackson s leadership It concerned the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States The First Bank of the United States had been established in 1791 under Alexander Hamilton s guidance and had been chartered for a 20 year period After the Revolutionary War the United States had a large war debt to France and others and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray as state banks printed their own currency and the plethora of different bank notes made commerce difficult Hamilton s national bank had been chartered to solve the debt problem and to unify the nation under one currency While it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade it was resented by Westerners and workers who believed that it was granting special favors to a few powerful men When its charter expired in 1811 it was not renewed For the next few years the banking business was in the hands of State Chartered banks which issued currency in excessive amounts creating great confusion and fueling inflation and concerns that state banks could not provide the country with a uniform currency The absence of a national bank during the War of 1812 greatly hindered financial operations of the government therefore a second Bank of the United States was created in 1816 From its inception the Second Bank was unpopular in the newer states and territories and with less prosperous people everywhere Opponents claimed the bank possessed a virtual monopoly over the country s credit and currency and reiterated that it represented the interests of the wealthy elite Jackson elected as a popular champion against it vetoed a bill to recharter the bank He also detested banks due to a brush with bankruptcy in his youth In his message to Congress he denounced monopoly and special privilege saying that our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits but have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress In the election campaign that followed the bank question caused a fundamental division between the merchant manufacturing and financial interests generally creditors who favored tight money and high interest rates and the laboring and agrarian sectors who were often in debt to banks and therefore favored an increased money supply and lower interest rates The outcome was an enthusiastic endorsement of Jacksonism Jackson saw his reelection in 1832 as a popular mandate to crush the bank irrevocably he found a ready made weapon in a provision of the bank s charter authorizing the removal of public funds In September 1833 Jackson ordered that no more government money be deposited in the bank and that the money already in its custody be gradually withdrawn in the ordinary course of meeting the expenses of government Carefully selected state banks stringently restricted were provided as a substitute For the next generation the US would get by on a relatively unregulated state banking system This banking system helped fuel westward expansion through easy credit but kept the nation vulnerable to periodic panics It was not until the Civil War that the Federal government again chartered a national bank Jackson groomed Martin Van Buren as his successor and he was easily elected president in 1836 However a few months into his administration the country fell into a deep economic slump known as the Panic of 1837 caused in large part by excessive speculation Banks failed and unemployment soared It was a devastating economic and social Catastrophe that can be compared with the panic of 1893 and the Great Depression of 1929 an event with repercussions every bit as deep as the Great Depression of the 1930s There was an international dimension much of the growth in the private sector and the investment in infrastructure by state governments had been financed by British capital Several states and corporations defaulted permanently on their debts owed to London For Europeans investment in America became a dubious proposition so American access to capital sharply declined for decades The depression had its roots in Jackson s economic hard money policies that blocked investment using paper money insisting on gold and silver But he had retired so his chosen successor van Buren was blamed for the disaster In the 1840 presidential election he was defeated by the Whig candidate William Henry Harrison and his running on a People s Crusade platform despite descending from a plantation family However his presidency would prove a non starter when he fell ill with pneumonia and died after only a month in office John Tyler the new vice president succeeded him Tyler was not popular since he had not been elected to the presidency and was widely referred to as His Accidency He rejected Wake economic policies so that party expelled him and The Whigs lost their opportunity to reshape government policy Economic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the Jacksonian era For the most part they follow the conclusions of Peter Temin who absolved Jackson s policies and blamed international events beyond American control such as conditions in Mexico China and Britain A survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with Temin s conclusion that the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond President Jackson s control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did vis a vis the Second Bank of the U S Age of Reform Spurred on by the Second Great Awakening Americans entered a period of rapid social change and experimentation New social movements arose as well as many new alternatives to traditional religious thought This period of American history was marked by the destruction of some traditional roles of society and the erection of new social standards One of the unique aspects of the Age of Reform was that it was heavily grounded in religion unlike the anti clericalism that characterized contemporary European reformers Second Great Awakening The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant religious revival movement that flourished in 1800 1840 in every region It expressed Arminian theology by which every person could be saved through a direct personal confrontation with Jesus Christ during an intensely emotional revival meeting Millions joined the churches often new denominations Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age so that the Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ For example the charismatic Charles Grandison Finney in upstate New York and the Old Northwest was highly effective At the Rochester Revival of 1830 prominent citizens concerned with the city s poverty and absenteeism had invited Finney to the city The wave of religious revival contributed to tremendous growth of the Methodist Baptists Disciples and other evangelical denominations Utopians As the Second Great Awakening challenged the traditional beliefs of the Calvinist faith the movement inspired other groups to call into question their views on religion and society Many of these utopianist groups also believed in millennialism which prophesied the return of Christ and the beginning of a new age The Harmony Society made three attempts to effect a millennial society with the most notable example at New Harmony Indiana Later Scottish industrialist Robert Owen bought New Harmony and attempted to form a secular Utopian community there Frenchman Charles Fourier began a similar secular experiment with his phalanxes spread across the Midwestern United States However none of these utopian communities lasted very long except for the Shakers One of the earliest movements was that of the Shakers who held all their possessions in common and lived in a prosperous inventive self supporting society with no sexual activity The Shakers founded by an English immigrant to the United States Mother Ann Lee peaked at around 6 000 in 1850 in communities from Maine to Kentucky The Shakers condemned sexuality and demanded absolute celibacy New members could only come from conversions and from children brought to the Shaker villages The Shakers persist to this day there is still an active Shaker community in Sabbathday Lake Maine but the Shaker population declined dramatically by the Civil War They are famed for their design especially their furniture and handicrafts The Perfectionist movement led by John Humphrey Noyes founded the utopian Oneida Community in 1848 with fifty one devotees in Oneida New York Noyes believed that the act of final conversion led to absolute and complete release from sin The Oneida Community believed in the abolition of marriage or monogamous relationships and that sex should be free to whoever consented to it As opposed to 20th century social movements such as the Sexual revolution of the 1960s the Onedians did not seek consequence free sex for mere pleasure but believed that because the logical outcome of intercourse was pregnancy that raising children should be a communal responsibility After the original founders died or became elderly their children rejected the concept of free love and returned to traditional family models Oneida thrived for many years as a joint stock company and continues today as a silverware company Mormon history began in this era under Joseph Smith s guidance after he experienced a religious conversion Because of their unusual beliefs which included recognition of the Book of Mormon as an additional book of scripture comparable to the Bible Mormons were rejected by mainstream Christians and forced to flee en masse from upstate New York to Ohio to Missouri and then to Nauvoo Illinois where Smith was killed and they were again forced to flee They Settled around the Great Salt Lake then part of Mexico In 1848 the region came under American control and later formed the Utah Territory National policy was to suppress polygamy and Utah was only admitted as a state in 1896 after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints backtracked from Smith s demand that all the leaders practice polygamy For Americans wishing to bridge the gap between the earthly and spiritual worlds spiritualism provided a means of communing with the dead Spiritualists used mediums to communicate between the living and the dead through a variety of different means The Fox sisters the most famous mediums claimed to have a direct link to the spirit world Spiritualism would gain a much larger following after the heavy number of casualties during the Civil War First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln was a believer Other groups seeking spiritual awakening also gained popularity in the mid 19th century Philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson began the American transcendentalist movement in New England to promote self reliance and better understanding of the universe through contemplation of the over soul Transcendentalism was essentially an American offshoot of the Romantic movement in Europe Among transcendentalists core beliefs was an ideal spiritual state that transcends the physical and is only realized through intuition rather than doctrine Like many of the movements the transcendentalists split over the idea of self reliance While Emerson and Henry David Thoreau promoted the idea of independent living George Ripley brought transcendentalists together in a phalanx at Brook Farm to live cooperatively Other authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe rejected transcendentalist beliefs So many of these new religious and spiritual groups began or concentrated within miles of each other in upstate New York that this area was nicknamed the burned over district because so few people had not converted Public schools movement Education in the United States had long been a local affair with schools governed by locally elected school boards As with much of the culture of the United States education varied widely in the North and the South In the New England states public education was common although it was often class based with the working class receiving little benefits Instruction and curriculum were all locally determined and teachers were expected to meet rigorous demands of strict moral behaviour Schools taught religious values and applied Calvinist philosophies of discipline which included corporal punishment and public humiliation In the South there was very little organization of a public education system Public schools were very rare and most education took place in the home with the family acting as instructors The wealthier planter families hired tutors for instruction in the classics but many yeoman farming families had little access to education outside of the family unit The reform movement in education began in Massachusetts when Horace Mann started the common school movement Mann advocated a statewide curriculum and instituted financing of school through local property taxes Mann also fought protracted battles against the Calvinist influence in discipline preferring positive reinforcement to physical punishment Most children learned to read and write and spell from Noah Webster s Blue Backed Speller and later the McGuffey Readers The readings inculcated moral values as well as literacy Most states tried to emulate Massachusetts and New England retained its leadership position for another century German immigrants brought in kindergartens and the Gymnasium school while Yankee orators sponsored the Lyceum movement that provided popular education for hundreds of towns and small cities Asylum movement The social conscience that was raised in the early 19th century helped to elevate the awareness of mental illness and its treatment A leading advocate of reform for mental illness was Dorothea Dix a Massachusetts woman who made an intensive study of the conditions that the mentally ill were kept in Dix s report to the Massachusetts state legislature along with the development of the Kirkbride Plan helped to alleviate the miserable conditions for many of the mentally ill Although these facilities often fell short of their intended purpose reformers continued to follow Dix s advocacy and call for increased study and treatment of mental illness Women Zagarri 2007 argues the Revolution created an ongoing debate on the rights of women and created an environment favorable to women s participation in politics She asserts that for a brief decades a comprehensive transformation in women s rights roles and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable p 8 However the opening of possibilities also engendered a backlash that actually set back the cause of women s rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political life Judith Sargent Murray published the early and influential essay On the Equality of the Sexes in 1790 blaming poor standards in female education as the root of women s problems However scandals surrounding the personal lives of English contemporaries Catharine Macaulay and Mary Wollstonecraft pushed feminist authorship into private correspondence from the 1790s through the early decades of the nineteenth century Feminist essays from John Neal in the 1820s filled an intellectual gap between Murray and her pre Seneca Falls Convention successors like Sarah Moore Grimk Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Margaret Fuller As a male writer insulated from many common forms of attack against female feminist thinkers Neal s advocacy was crucial to bringing the field back into the American mainstream During the building of the new republic American women gained a limited political voice in what is known as republican motherhood Under this philosophy as promoted by leaders such as Abigail Adams women were seen as the protectors of liberty and republicanism Mothers were charged with passing down these ideals to their children through instruction of patriotic thoughts and feelings During the 1830s and 1840s many of the changes in the status of women that occurred in the post Revolutionary period such as the belief in love between spouses and the role of women in the home continued at an accelerated pace This was an age of reform movements in which Americans sought to improve the moral fiber of themselves and of their nation in unprecedented numbers The wife s role in this process was important because she was seen as the cultivator of morality in her husband and children Besides domesticity women were also expected to be pious pure and submissive to men These four components were considered by many at the time to be the natural state of womanhood echoes of this ideology still existing today The view that the wife should find fulfillment in these values is called the Cult of True Womanhood or the Cult of Domesticity Under the doctrine of two spheres women were to exist in the domestic sphere at home while their husbands operated in the public sphere of politics and business Women took on the new role of softening their husbands and instructing their children in piety and not republican values while men handled the business and financial affairs of the family Some doctors of this period even went so far as to suggest that women should not get an education lest they divert blood away from the uterus to the brain and produce weak children The coverture laws ensured that men would hold political power over their wives Anti slavery movements By 1800 many political leaders were convinced that slavery was undesirable and should eventually be abolished and the slaves returned to their natural homes in Africa The American Colonization Society which was active in both North and South tried to implement these ideas and established the colony of Liberia in Africa to repatriate slaves out of white society Prominent leaders included Henry Clay and President James Monroe who gave his name to Monrovia the capital of Liberia However after 1840 many abolitionists rejected the idea of repatriation to Africa The abolitionist movement among white Protestants was based on evangelical principles of the Second Great Awakening Evangelist Theodore Weld led abolitionist revivals that called for immediate emancipation of slaves William Lloyd Garrison founded The Liberator an anti slavery newspaper and the American Anti Slavery Society to call for abolition A controversial figure Garrison often was the focus of public anger His advocacy of women s rights and inclusion of women in the leadership of the society caused a rift within the movement Rejecting Garrison s idea that abolition and women s rights were connected Lewis Tappan broke with the society and formed the American and Foreign Anti Slavery Society Most abolitionists were not as extreme as Garrison who vowed that The Liberator would not cease publication until slavery was abolished White abolitionists did not always face agreeable communities in the North Garrison was almost lynched in Boston while newspaper publisher Elijah Lovejoy was killed in Alton Illinois The anger over abolition even spilled over into Congress where a gag rule was instituted to prevent any discussion of slavery on the floor of either chamber Most whites viewed African Americans as an inferior race and had little taste for abolitionists often assuming that all were like Garrison African Americans had little freedom even in states where slavery was not permitted They were shunned by whites subjected to discriminatory laws and often forced to compete with Irish immigrants for menial low wage jobs In the South meanwhile planters argued that slavery was necessary to operate their plantations profitably and that emancipated slaves would attempt to Africanize the country as they had done in Haiti Both free born African American citizens and former slaves took on leading roles in abolitionism as well The most prominent spokesperson for abolition in the African American community was Frederick Douglass an escaped slave whose eloquent condemnations of slavery drew both crowds of supporters as well as threats against his life Douglass was a keen user of the printed word both through his newspaper The North Star and three best selling autobiographies At one extreme David Walker published An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World calling for African American revolt against white tyranny The Underground Railroad helped some slaves out of the South through a series of trails and safe houses known as stations Known as conductors escaped slaves volunteered to return to the South to lead others to safety former slaves such as Harriet Tubman risked their lives on these journeys Women as abolitionists Angelia and Sarah Grimk were southerners who moved North to advocate against slavery The American Anti Slavery Society welcomed women Garrison along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott were so appalled that women were not allowed to participate at the World Anti Slavery Convention in London that they called for a women s rights convention in Seneca Falls New York It was at this convention that Sojourner Truth became recognized as a leading spokesperson for both abolition and women s rights Women abolitionists increasingly began to compare women s situation with the plight of slaves This new polemic squarely blamed men for all the restrictions of women s role and argued that the relationship between the sexes was one sided controlling and oppressive There were strong religious roots most feminists emerged from the Quaker and Congregationalist churches in the Northeast Prohibition Alcohol consumption was another target of reformers in the 1850s Americans drank heavily which contributed to violent behaviour crime health problems and poor workplace performance Groups such as the American Temperance Society condemned liquor as a scourge on society and urged temperance among their followers The state of Maine attempted in 1851 to ban alcohol sales and production entirely but it met resistance and was abandoned The prohibition movement was forgotten during the Civil War but would return in the 1870s Economic growth In this period the United States rapidly expanded economically from an agrarian nation into an industrial power Industrialization in America involved two important developments First transportation was expanded Second improvements were made to industrial processes such as the use of interchangeable parts and railroads to ship goods more quickly The government helped protect American manufacturers by passing a protective tariff Social mobility The steady expansion and rapid population growth of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies Visitors described the rough sometimes violent but mostly optimistic and forward looking attitude of most Americans While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants and could make provisions for land for his children Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful For example in Germany the universities the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons for tens of thousands of pounds Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe but they seldom had social prestige or political power By contrast the U S had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850 Most rich Americans had well to do fathers but their grandfathers were of average wealth Poor boys of the 1850s like Andrew Carnegie and John D Rockefeller were two of the richest men in the world by 1900 Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time and over generations with the Carnegie like rags to riches scenario a rare one Some ethnic groups like Yankees Irish and Jews prized upward mobility and emphasized education as the fastest route other groups such as Germans Poles and Italians emphasized family stability and home ownership more Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers often out west Westward expansion After 1815 the United States shifted its attention away from foreign policy to internal development With the defeat of the eastern Indians in the War of 1812 American settlers moved in great numbers into the rich farmlands of the Midwest Westward expansion was mostly undertaken by groups of young families Daniel Boone was one frontiersman who pioneered the settlement of Kentucky In the 1830s the federal government forcibly deported the southeastern tribes to their own reservations in the Indian territory now Oklahoma via the Trail of Tears There they received annual subsidies of food and supplies Before the settlers arrived in the far west the fur trappers and Mountain men had their day As skilled hunters they trapped beaver for eventual sale to the European fashion industry After the demise of the fur trade they established trading posts throughout the west continued trade with the Indians and served as guides and hunters for the western migration of settlers to Utah and the Pacific coast Texas Oregon California and Manifest Destiny Manifest Destiny was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across the continent This concept was born out of A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven The phrase Manifest Destiny meant many different things to many different people and was rejected by many Americans Howe argues that American imperialism did not represent an American consensus it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity Faragher s analysis of the political polarization between the Democratic Party and the Whig Party is that Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion whereas many Whigs especially in the North were opposed Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country s existing boundaries they feared correctly that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the territories On the other hand many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed For many Democrats the answer to the nation s social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization Manifest destiny did however provide the rhetorical tone for the largest acquisition of U S territory It was used by Democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with Mexico It was also used to threaten war with Britain but President Polk negotiated a compromise that divided the Oregon Country half and half Merk concludes From the outset Manifest Destiny vast in program in its sense of continentalism was slight in support It lacked national sectional or party following commensurate with its bigness The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit The thesis that it embodied nationalism found in much historical writing is backed by little real supporting evidence Mexican American War 1846 1848 After a bitter debate in Congress the Republic of Texas was voluntarily annexed in 1845 which Mexico had repeatedly warned meant war In May 1846 Congress declared war on Mexico after Mexican troops massacred a U S Army detachment in a disputed unsettled area However the homefront was polarized as Whigs opposed and Democrats supported the war The U S Army augmented by tens of thousands of volunteers commanded by General Zachary Taylor defeated Santa Anna s in northern Mexico while other American forces quickly took possession of New Mexico and California Mexico continued to resist despite a chaotic political situation and so Polk launched an invasion of the country s heartland A new American army led by Winfield Scott occupied the port of Veracruz and pressed inland amid bloody fighting Santa Anna offered to cede Texas and California north of Monterey Bay but negotiations broke down and the fighting resumed In September 1847 Scott s army captured Mexico City Santa Anna was forced to flee and a provisional government began the task of negotiating peace The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2 1848 It recognized the Rio Grande as the southern boundary of Texas and ceded what is now the states of California Nevada Utah Colorado Arizona and New Mexico to the United States while also paying Mexico 15 000 000 for the territory In the presidential election of 1848 Zachary Taylor ran as a Whig and won easily when the Democrats split even though he was an apolitical military man who never voted in his life Scott became the last Whig candidate for president in 1852 and he lost badly With Texas and Florida having been admitted to the union as slave states in 1845 California was entered as a free state in 1850 after its state convention unanimously voted to ban slavery Major events in the western movement of the U S population were the Homestead Act a law by which for a nominal price a settler was given title to 160 acres 65 ha of land to farm the opening of the Oregon Territory to settlement the Texas Revolution the opening of the Oregon Trail the Mormon Emigration to Utah in

                        "text": "Even before the nullification issue had been settled another controversy arose to challenge Jackson s leadership It concerned the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States The First Bank of the United States had been established in 1791 under Alexander Hamilton s guidance and had been chartered for a 20 year period After the Revolutionary War the United States had a large war debt to France and others and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray as state banks printed their own currency and the plethora of different bank notes made commerce difficult Hamilton s national bank had been chartered to solve the debt problem and to unify the nation under one currency While it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade it was resented by Westerners and workers who believed that it was granting special favors to a few powerful men When its charter expired in 1811 it was not renewed For the next few years the banking business was in the hands of State Chartered banks which issued currency in excessive amounts creating great confusion and fueling inflation and concerns that state banks could not provide the country with a uniform currency The absence of a national bank during the War of 1812 greatly hindered financial operations of the government therefore a second Bank of the United States was created in 1816 From its inception the Second Bank was unpopular in the newer states and territories and with less prosperous people everywhere Opponents claimed the bank possessed a virtual monopoly over the country s credit and currency and reiterated that it represented the interests of the wealthy elite Jackson elected as a popular champion against it vetoed a bill to recharter the bank He also detested banks due to a brush with bankruptcy in his youth In his message to Congress he denounced monopoly and special privilege saying that our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits but have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress In the election campaign that followed the bank question caused a fundamental division between the merchant manufacturing and financial interests generally creditors who favored tight money and high interest rates and the laboring and agrarian sectors who were often in debt to banks and therefore favored an increased money supply and lower interest rates The outcome was an enthusiastic endorsement of Jacksonism Jackson saw his reelection in 1832 as a popular mandate to crush the bank irrevocably he found a ready made weapon in a provision of the bank s charter authorizing the removal of public funds In September 1833 Jackson ordered that no more government money be deposited in the bank and that the money already in its custody be gradually withdrawn in the ordinary course of meeting the expenses of government Carefully selected state banks stringently restricted were provided as a substitute For the next generation the US would get by on a relatively unregulated state banking system This banking system helped fuel westward expansion through easy credit but kept the nation vulnerable to periodic panics It was not until the Civil War that the Federal government again chartered a national bank Jackson groomed Martin Van Buren as his successor and he was easily elected president in 1836 However a few months into his administration the country fell into a deep economic slump known as the Panic of 1837 caused in large part by excessive speculation Banks failed and unemployment soared It was a devastating economic and social Catastrophe that can be compared with the panic of 1893 and the Great Depression of 1929 an event with repercussions every bit as deep as the Great Depression of the 1930s There was an international dimension much of the growth in the private sector and the investment in infrastructure by state governments had been financed by British capital Several states and corporations defaulted permanently on their debts owed to London For Europeans investment in America became a dubious proposition so American access to capital sharply declined for decades The depression had its roots in Jackson s economic hard money policies that blocked investment using paper money insisting on gold and silver But he had retired so his chosen successor van Buren was blamed for the disaster In the 1840 presidential election he was defeated by the Whig candidate William Henry Harrison and his running on a People s Crusade platform despite descending from a plantation family However his presidency would prove a non starter when he fell ill with pneumonia and died after only a month in office John Tyler the new vice president succeeded him Tyler was not popular since he had not been elected to the presidency and was widely referred to as His Accidency He rejected Wake economic policies so that party expelled him and The Whigs lost their opportunity to reshape government policy Economic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the Jacksonian era For the most part they follow the conclusions of Peter Temin who absolved Jackson s policies and blamed international events beyond American control such as conditions in Mexico China and Britain A survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with Temin s conclusion that the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond President Jackson s control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did vis a vis the Second Bank of the U S ",

    "Supreme Court of the United States": {
        "text": "The Supreme Court of the United States SCOTUS is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all U S federal court cases and over state court cases that turn on questions of U S constitutional or federal law It also has original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases specifically all Cases affecting Ambassadors other public Ministers and Consuls and those in which a State shall be Party The court holds the power of judicial review the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law Established by Article Three of the United States Constitution the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789 The court consists of nine justices the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices and the justices meet at the Supreme Court Building in Washington D C Justices have lifetime tenure meaning they remain on the court until they die retire resign or are impeached and removed from office When a vacancy occurs the president with the advice and consent of the Senate appoints a new justice Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before the court When in the majority the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court otherwise the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion The Supreme Court receives on average about 7 000 petitions for writs of certiorari each year but grants only about 80 History It was while debating the separation of powers between the legislative and executive departments that delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention established the parameters for the national judiciary Creating a third branch of government was a novel idea in the English tradition judicial matters had been treated as an aspect of royal executive authority Early on the delegates who were opposed to having a strong central government argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts while others including James Madison advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of tribunals chosen by the national legislature It was proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive s power to veto or revise laws Eventually the framers compromised by sketching only a general outline of the judiciary in Article Three of the United States Constitution vesting federal judicial power in one supreme Court and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish They delineated neither the exact powers and prerogatives of the Supreme Court nor the organization of the judicial branch as a whole The 1st United States Congress provided the detailed organization of a federal judiciary through the Judiciary Act of 1789 The Supreme Court the country s highest judicial tribunal was to sit in the nation s capital and would initially be composed of a chief justice and five associate justices The act also divided the country into judicial districts which were in turn organized into circuits Justices were required to ride circuit and hold circuit court twice a year in their assigned judicial district Immediately after signing the act into law President George Washington nominated the following people to serve on the court John Jay for chief justice and John Rutledge William Cushing Robert H Harrison James Wilson and John Blair Jr as associate justices All six were confirmed by the Senate on September 26 1789 however Harrison declined to serve and Washington later nominated James Iredell in his place The Supreme Court held its inaugural session from February 2 through February 10 1790 at the Royal Exchange in New York City then the U S capital A second session was held there in August 1790 The earliest sessions of the court were devoted to organizational proceedings as the first cases did not reach it until 1791 When the nation s capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1790 the Supreme Court did so as well After initially meeting at Independence Hall the court established its chambers at City Hall Early beginnings Under chief justices Jay Rutledge and Ellsworth 1789 1801 the court heard few cases its first decision was West v Barnes 1791 a case involving procedure As the court initially had only six members every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two thirds voting four to two However Congress has always allowed less than the court s full membership to make decisions starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789 The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige a situation not helped by the era s highest profile case Chisholm v Georgia 1793 which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment The court s power and prestige grew substantially during the Marshall Court 1801 1835 Under Marshall the court established the power of judicial review over acts of Congress including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution Marbury v Madison and making several important constitutional rulings that gave shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and states notably Martin v Hunter s Lessee McCulloch v Maryland and Gibbons v Ogden The Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion seriatim a remnant of British tradition and instead issuing a single majority opinion Also during Marshall s tenure although beyond the court s control the impeachment and acquittal of Justice Samuel Chase from 1804 to 1805 helped cement the principle of judicial independence From Taney to Taft The Taney Court 1836 1864 made several important rulings such as Sheldon v Sill which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects Nevertheless it is primarily remembered for its ruling in Dred Scott v Sandford which helped precipitate the American Civil War In the Reconstruction era the Chase Waite and Fuller Courts 1864 1910 interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution and developed the doctrine of substantive due process Lochner v New York Adair v United States The size of the court was last changed in 1869 when it was set at nine Under the White and Taft Courts 1910 1930 the court held that the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states Gitlow v New York grappled with the new antitrust statutes Standard Oil Co of New Jersey v United States upheld the constitutionality of military conscription Selective Draft Law Cases and brought the substantive due process doctrine to its first apogee Adkins v Children s Hospital New Deal era During the Hughes Stone and Vinson courts 1930 1953 the court gained its own accommodation in 1935 and changed its interpretation of the Constitution giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin D Roosevelt s New Deal most prominently West Coast Hotel Co v Parrish Wickard v Filburn United States v Darby and United States v Butler During World War II the court continued to favor government power upholding the internment of Japanese Americans Korematsu v United States and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance Minersville School District v Gobitis Nevertheless Gobitis was soon repudiated West Virginia State Board of Education v Barnette and the Steel Seizure Case restricted the pro government trend The Warren Court 1953 1969 dramatically expanded the force of Constitutional civil liberties It held that segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment Brown v Board of Education Bolling v Sharpe and Green v County School Bd and that legislative districts must be roughly equal in population Reynolds v Sims It recognized a general right to privacy Griswold v Connecticut limited the role of religion in public school most prominently Engel v Vitale and Abington School District v Schempp incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states prominently Mapp v Ohio the exclusionary rule and Gideon v Wainwright right to appointed counsel and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police Miranda v Arizona At the same time the court limited defamation suits by public figures New York Times Co v Sullivan and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories Burger Rehnquist and Roberts The Burger Court 1969 1986 saw a conservative shift It also expanded Griswold s right to privacy to strike down abortion laws Roe v Wade but divided deeply on affirmative action Regents of the University of California v Bakke and campaign finance regulation Buckley v Valeo It also wavered on the death penalty ruling first that most applications were defective Furman v Georgia but later that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional Gregg v Georgia The Rehnquist Court 1986 2005 was known for its revival of judicial enforcement of federalism emphasizing the limits of the Constitution s affirmative grants of power United States v Lopez and the force of its restrictions on those powers Seminole Tribe v Florida City of Boerne v Flores It struck down single sex state schools as a violation of equal protection United States v Virginia laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process Lawrence v Texas and the line item veto Clinton v New York but upheld school vouchers Zelman v Simmons Harris and reaffirmed Roe s restrictions on abortion laws Planned Parenthood v Casey The court s decision in Bush v Gore which ended the electoral recount during the 2000 United States presidential election remains especially controversial with debate ongoing over the rightful winner and whether or not the ruling should set a precedent The Roberts Court 2005 present is regarded as more conservative and controversial than the Rehnquist Court Some of its major rulings have concerned federal preemption Wyeth v Levine civil procedure Twombly Iqbal voting rights and federal preclearance Shelby County Brnovich abortion Gonzales v Carhart and Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization climate change Massachusetts v EPA same sex marriage United States v Windsor and Obergefell v Hodges and the Bill of Rights such as in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission and Americans for Prosperity Foundation v Bonta First Amendment Heller McDonald Bruen Second Amendment and Baze v Rees Eighth Amendment Composition Nomination confirmation and appointment Article II Section 2 Clause 2 of the United States Constitution known as the Appointments Clause empowers the president to nominate and with the confirmation advice and consent of the United States Senate to appoint public officials including justices of the Supreme Court This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution The president has the plenary power to nominate while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice such as age citizenship residence or prior judicial experience thus a president may nominate anyone to serve and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose In modern times the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group s views The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive negative or neutral report The committee s practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925 who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955 Once the committee reports out the nomination the full Senate considers it Rejections are relatively uncommon the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees most recently Robert Bork nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 Although Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative or tied vote in committee to block a nomination prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by filibuster once debate had begun in the full Senate President Lyndon B Johnson s nomination of sitting associate justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas s ethics President Donald Trump s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia s death was the second Unlike the Fortas filibuster only Democratic senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy and the Republican majority s prior refusal to take up President Barack Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations Not every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee this occurred with President George W Bush s nomination of Harriet Miers in 2005 The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination which expires at the end of the session President Dwight Eisenhower s first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate Eisenhower re nominated Harlan in January 1955 and Harlan was confirmed two months later Most recently the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland as the nomination expired in January 2017 and the vacancy was filled by Neil Gorsuch an appointee of President Trump Once the Senate confirms a nomination the president must prepare and sign a commission to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed before the appointee can take office The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date not the confirmation or swearing in date After receiving their commission the appointee must then take the two prescribed oaths before assuming their official duties The importance of the oath taking is underscored by the case of Edwin M Stanton Although confirmed by the Senate on December 20 1869 and duly commissioned as an associate justice by President Ulysses S Grant Stanton died on December 24 prior to taking the prescribed oaths He is not therefore considered to have been a member of the court Before 1981 the approval process of justices was usually rapid From the Truman through Nixon administrations justices were typically approved within one month From the Reagan administration to the present the process has taken much longer and some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past According to the Congressional Research Service the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days 2 2 months while the median is 71 days 2 3 months Recess appointments When the Senate is in recess a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session less than two years The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed No U S president since Dwight D Eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the court and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts In 1960 after Eisenhower had made three such appointments the Senate passed a sense of the Senate resolution that recess appointments to the court should only be made in unusual circumstances such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of Congress s views in the hope of guiding executive action The Supreme Court s 2014 decision in National Labor Relations Board v Noel Canning limited the ability of the president to make recess appointments including appointments to the Supreme Court the court ruled that the Senate decides when the Senate is in session or in recess Writing for the court Justice Breyer stated We hold that for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause the Senate is in session when it says it is provided that under its own rules it retains the capacity to transact Senate business This ruling allows the Senate to prevent recess appointments through the use of pro forma sessions Tenure Lifetime tenure of justices can only be found for US Supreme Court Justices and the State of Rhode Island s Supreme Court justices with all other democratic nations and all other US states having set term limits or mandatory retirement ages Larry Sabato wrote The insularity of lifetime tenure combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has produced a critical time lag with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times Proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices as proposed by Levinson and Sabato and a mandatory retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein among others Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 78 argued that one benefit of lifetime tenure was that nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office Article Three Section 1 of the Constitution provides that justices shall hold their offices during good behavior which is understood to mean that they may serve for the remainder of their lives until death furthermore the phrase is generally interpreted to mean that the only way justices can be removed from office is by Congress via the impeachment process The Framers of the Constitution chose good behavior tenure to limit the power to remove justices and to ensure judicial independence No constitutional mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury but unable or unwilling to resign The only justice ever to be impeached was Samuel Chase in 1804 The House of Representatives adopted eight articles of impeachment against him however he was acquitted by the Senate and remained in office until his death in 1811 No subsequent effort to impeach a sitting justice has progressed beyond referral to the Judiciary Committee For example William O Douglas was the subject of hearings twice in 1953 and again in 1970 and Abe Fortas resigned while hearings were being organized in 1969 Because justices have indefinite tenure timing of vacancies can be unpredictable Sometimes they arise in quick succession as in September 1971 when Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II left within days of each other the shortest period of time between vacancies in the court s history Sometimes a great length of time passes between vacancies such as the 11 year span from 1994 to 2005 from the retirement of Harry Blackmun to the death of William Rehnquist which was the second longest timespan between vacancies in the court s history On average a new justice joins the court about every two years Despite the variability all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office although his successor John Tyler made an appointment during that presidential term Likewise Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office but his successor Millard Fillmore also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term Andrew Johnson who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the size of the court Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice Presidents James Monroe Franklin D Roosevelt and George W Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment Size of the court One of the smallest Supreme Courts in the world the US Supreme Court consists of nine members one chief justice and eight associate justices The U S Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court nor does it specify any specific positions for the court s members The Constitution assumes the existence of the office of the chief justice because it mentions in Article I Section 3 Clause 6 that the Chief Justice must preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States The power to define the Supreme Court s size and membership has been assumed to belong to Congress which initially established a six member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789 The size of the court was first altered by the Midnight Judges Act of 1801 which would have reduced the size of the court to five members upon its next vacancy as federal judges have life tenure but the Judiciary Act of 1802 promptly negated the 1801 act restoring the court s size to six members before any such vacancy occurred As the nation s boundaries grew across the continent and as Supreme Court justices in those days had to ride the circuit an arduous process requiring long travel on horseback or carriage over harsh terrain that resulted in months long extended stays away from home Congress added justices to correspond with the growth such that the number of seats for associate justices plus the chief justice became seven in 1807 nine in 1837 and ten in 1863 At the behest of Chief Justice Chase and in an attempt by the Republican Congress to limit the power of Democrat Andrew Johnson Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition Consequently one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867 Soon after Johnson left office the new president Ulysses S Grant a Republican signed into law the Judiciary Act of 1869 This returned the number of justices to nine where it has since remained and allowed Grant to immediately appoint two more judges President Franklin D Roosevelt attempted to expand the court in 1937 His proposal envisioned the appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement up to a maximum bench of 15 justices The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to pack the court with justices who would support Roosevelt s New Deal The plan usually called the court packing plan failed in Congress after members of Roosevelt s own Democratic Party believed it to be unconstitutional It was defeated 70 20 in the Senate and the Senate Judiciary Committee reported that it was essential to the continuance of our constitutional democracy that the proposal be so emphatically rejected that its parallel will never again be presented to the free representatives of the free people of America The expansion of the 5 4 conservative majority on the court to a 6 3 supermajority during the presidency of Donald Trump led Joan Biskupic of CNN to consider the court the most conservative since the 1930s with Republicans appointing 14 of the last 18 justices Some Democrats have called for an expansion in the court s size to fix what they see as an imbalance In April 2021 during the 117th Congress some Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced the Judiciary Act of 2021 a bill to expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 seats It met opposition within the party and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refused to bring it to the floor Shortly after taking office in January 2021 Joe Biden established a presidential commission to study possible reforms to the Supreme Court The commission s December 2021 final report discussed but took no position on expanding the size of the court At nine members the U S Supreme Court is one of the smallest supreme courts in the world David Litt argues the court is too small to represent the perspectives of a country the United States size Lawyer and legal scholar Jonathan Turley advocates for 19 justices with the court being gradually expanded by two new members per presidential term bringing the U S Supreme Court to a similar size as its counterparts in other developed countries He says that a bigger court would reduce the power of the swing justice ensure the court has a greater diversity of views and make confirmation of new justices less politically contentious Membership Current justices There are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices Among the current members of the court Clarence Thomas is the longest serving justice with a tenure of 11 864 days 32 years 176 days as of April 16 2024 the most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson whose tenure began on June 30 2022 after being confirmed by the senate on April 7 This graphical timeline depicts the length of each current Supreme Court justice s tenure not seniority as the chief justice has seniority over all associate justices regardless of tenure on the court Court demographics The court currently has five male and four female justices Among the nine justices there are two African American justices Justices Thomas and Jackson and one Hispanic justice Justice Sotomayor One of the justices was born to at least one immigrant parent Justice Alito s father was born in Italy At least six justices are Roman Catholics one is Jewish and one is Protestant It is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian Historically most justices have been Protestants including 36 Episcopalians 19 Presbyterians 10 Unitarians 5 Methodists and 3 Baptists The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836 and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice Louis Brandeis In recent years the historical situation has reversed as most recent justices have been either Catholic or Jewish Three justices are from the state of New York two are from Washington D C and one each is from New Jersey Georgia Colorado and Louisiana Eight of the current justices received their Juris Doctor from an Ivy League law school Neil Gorsuch Ketanji Brown Jackson Elena Kagan and John Roberts from Harvard plus Samuel Alito Brett Kavanaugh Sonia Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas from Yale Only Amy Coney Barrett did not she received her Juris Doctor at Notre Dame Previous positions or offices judicial or federal government prior to joining the court by order of seniority following the Chief Justice include For much of the court s history every justice was a man of Northwestern European descent and almost always Protestant Diversity concerns focused on geography to represent all regions of the country rather than religious ethnic or gender diversity Racial ethnic and gender diversity in the court increased in the late 20th century Thurgood Marshall became the first African American justice in 1967 Sandra Day O Connor became the first female justice in 1981 In 1986 Antonin Scalia became the first Italian American justice Marshall was succeeded by African American Clarence Thomas in 1991 O Connor was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg the first Jewish woman on the Court in 1993 After O Connor s retirement Ginsburg was joined in 2009 by Sonia Sotomayor the first Hispanic and Latina justice and in 2010 by Elena Kagan After Ginsburg s death on September 18 2020 Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed as the fifth woman in the court s history on October 26 2020 Ketanji Brown Jackson is the sixth woman and first African American woman on the court There have been six foreign born justices in the court s history James Wilson 1789 1798 born in Caskardy Scotland James Iredell 1790 1799 born in Lewes England William Paterson 1793 1806 born in County Antrim Ireland David Brewer 1889 1910 born to American missionaries in Smyrna Ottoman Empire now zmir Turkey George Sutherland 1922 1939 born in Buckinghamshire England and Felix Frankfurter 1939 1962 born in Vienna Austria Hungary now in Austria Since 1789 about one third of the justices have been U S military veterans Samuel Alito is the only veteran currently serving on the court Retired justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy also served in the U S military Judicial leanings Justices are nominated by the president in power and receive confirmation by the Senate historically holding many of the views of the nominating president s political party While justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches organizations such as the Federalist Society do officially filter and endorse judges that have a sufficiently conservative view of the law Jurists are often informally categorized in the media as being conservatives or liberal Attempts to quantify the ideologies of jurists include the Segal Cover score Martin Quinn score and Judicial Common Space score Devins and Baum argue that before 2010 the Court never had clear ideological blocs that fell perfectly along party lines In choosing their appointments Presidents often focused more on friendship and political connections than on ideology Republican presidents sometimes appointed liberals and Democratic presidents sometimes appointed conservatives As a result between 1790 and early 2010 there were only two decisions that the Guide to the U S Supreme Court designated as important and that had at least two dissenting votes in which the Justices divided along party lines about one half of one percent 316 Even in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s Democratic and Republican elites tended to agree on some major issues especially concerning civil rights and civil liberties and so did the justices But since 1991 they argue ideology has been much more important in choosing justices all Republican appointees have been committed conservatives and all Democratic appointees have been liberals 331 344 As the more moderate Republican justices retired the court has become more partisan The Court became more divided sharply along partisan lines with justices appointed by Republican presidents taking increasingly conservative positions and those appointed by Democrats taking moderate liberal positions 357 Following the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg the court is composed of six justices appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by Democratic presidents It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas Alito Gorsuch Kavanaugh and Barrett appointed by Republican presidents compose the court s conservative wing and that Justices Sotomayor Kagan and Jackson appointed by Democratic presidents compose the court s liberal wing Prior to Justice Ginsburg s death in 2020 the conservative Chief Justice Roberts was sometimes described as the court s median justice with four justices more liberal and four more conservative than him Darragh Roche argues that Kavanaugh as 2021 s median justice exemplifies the rightward shift in the court FiveThirtyEight found the number of unanimous decisions dropped from the 20 year average of nearly 50 to nearly 30 in 2021 while party line rulings increased from a 60 year average just above zero to a record high 21 That year Ryan Williams pointed to the party line votes for confirmations of justices as evidence that the court is of partisan importance to the Senate In 2022 Simon Lazarus of Brookings critiqued the U S Supreme Court as an increasingly partisan institution Retired justices There are currently three living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States Anthony Kennedy David Souter and Stephen Breyer As retired justices they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts usually the United States Courts of Appeals Such assignments are formally made by the chief justice on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice In recent years Justice Souter has frequently sat on the First Circuit the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status and eligibility of a Supreme Court justice to assume retired status rather than simply resign from the bench is governed by the same age and service criteria In recent times justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal institutional ideological partisan and political factors playing a role The fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down The desire to maximize the court s strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time when the court is in recess and during non presidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health Finally especially in recent decades many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office to ensure that a like minded successor would be appointed Salary As of 2024 associate justices receive a yearly salary of 298 500 and the chief justice is paid 312 200 per year Once a justice meets age and service requirements the justice may retire with a pension based on the same formula used for federal employees As with other federal courts judges their pension can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement according to the Compensation Clause of Article III of the Constitution Seniority and seating For the most part the day to day activities of the justices are governed by rules of protocol based upon the seniority of justices The chief justice always ranks first in the order of precedence regardless of the length of their service The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service The chief justice sits in the center on the bench or at the head of the table during conferences The other justices are seated in order of seniority The senior most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice s right the second most senior sits immediately to their left The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority with the most junior justice occupying the last seat Therefore since the October 2022 term the court sits as follows from left to right from the perspective of those facing the court Barrett Gorsuch Sotomayor Thomas most senior associate justice Roberts chief justice Alito Kagan Kavanaugh and Jackson Likewise when the members of the court gather for official group photographs justices are arranged in order of seniority with the five most senior members seated in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions currently from left to right Sotomayor Thomas Roberts Alito and Kagan and the four most junior justices standing behind them again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions Barrett Gorsuch Kavanaugh and Jackson In the justices private conferences current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority beginning with the chief justice first and ending with the most junior associate justice By custom the most junior associate justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as they convene alone such as answering the door of their conference room serving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk Facilities The Supreme Court first met on February 1 1790 at the Merchants Exchange Building in New York City When Philadelphia became the capital the court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800 After the government moved to Washington D C the court occupied various spaces in the Capitol building until 1935 when it moved into its own purpose built home The four story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress and is clad in marble The building includes the courtroom justices chambers an extensive law library various meeting spaces and auxiliary services including a gymnasium The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol but maintains its own Supreme Court Police separate from the Capitol Police Located across First Street from the United States Capitol at One First Street NE and Maryland Avenue the building is open to the public from 9 am to 4 30 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied There is a cafeteria a gift shop exhibits and a half hour informational film When the court is not in session lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9 30 am to 3 30 pm and reservations are not necessary When the court is in session the public may attend oral arguments which are held twice each morning and sometimes afternoons on Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays in two week intervals from October through late April with breaks during December and February Visitors are seated on a first come first served basis One estimate is there are about 250 seats available The number of open seats varies from case to case for important cases some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night The court releases opinions beginning at 10 am on scheduled non argument days also called opinion days These sessions which typically last 15 to 30 minute are also open to the public From mid May until the end of June at least one opinion day is scheduled each week Supreme Court Police are available to answer questions Jurisdiction Congress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court s appellate jurisdiction The Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states but may decline to hear such cases It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors other public ministers consuls or vice consuls of foreign states are parties all controversies between the United States and a State and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens In 1906 the court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for contempt of court in United States v Shipp The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the court s history The contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of Ed Johnson in Chattanooga Tennessee the evening after Justice John Marshall Harlan granted Johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal Johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded and hanged from a bridge after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on Johnson s body reading To Justice Harlan Come get your nigger now The local sheriff John Shipp cited the Supreme Court s intervention as the rationale for the lynching The court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in Washington before the Supreme Court justices who found nine individuals guilty of contempt sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail In all other cases the court has only appellate jurisdiction including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal In practice the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the court are disputes between two or more states The court s appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal through certiorari certiorari before judgment and certified questions the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces through certiorari the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico through certiorari the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands through certiorari the District of Columbia Court of Appeals through certiorari and final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had through certiorari In the last case an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state s highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal For example a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U S Supreme Court if a the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant certiorari e g Florida Star v B J F or b the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court s decision without discussing the merits of the case since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts rather than just federal courts was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the court s history by its rulings in Martin v Hunter s Lessee 1816 and Cohens v Virginia 1821 The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions although there are several devices that permit so called collateral review of state cases It has to be noted that this collateral review often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system Since Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain cases or controversies the Supreme Court cannot decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions as the supreme courts of some states may do For example in DeFunis v Odegaard 1974 the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered However the court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot If an issue is capable of repetition yet evading review the court would address it even though the party before the court would not themselves be made whole by a favorable result In Roe v Wade 1973 and other abortion cases the court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct in which the court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff s need for relief Justices as circuit justices The United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals each of which is assigned a circuit justice from the Supreme Court Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic its meaning has changed through time Under the Judiciary Act of 1789 each justice was required to ride circuit or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges This practice encountered opposition from many justices who cited the difficulty of travel Moreover there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit Circuit riding ended in 1901 when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed and circuit riding was officially abolished by Congress in 1911 The circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that by law and the rules of the court may be addressed by a single justice Ordinarily a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it granted or denied or entering a standard form of order however the justice may elect to write an opinion referred to as an in chambers opinion Congress has specifically authorized one justice to issue a stay pending certiorari in 28 U S C 2101 f Each justice also decides routine procedural requests such as for extensions of time Before 1990 the rules of the Supreme Court also stated that a writ of injunction may be granted by any Justice in a case where it might be granted by the Court However this part of the rule and all other specific mention of injunctions was removed in the Supreme Court s rules revision of December 1989 Nevertheless requests for injunctions under the All Writs Act are sometimes directed to the circuit justice In the past circuit justices also sometimes granted motions for bail in criminal cases writs of habeas corpus and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal A circuit justice may sit as a judge on the Court of Appeals of that circuit but over the past hundred years this has rarely occurred A circuit justice sitting with the Court of Appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit The chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit the Fourth Circuit which includes Maryland and Virginia the states surrounding the District of Columbia and since it was established the Federal Circuit Each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits As of September 28 2022 the allotment of the justices among the circuits is as follows Five of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges Chief Justice Roberts D C Circuit Justice Sotomayor Second Circuit Justice Alito Third Circuit Justice Barrett Seventh Circuit and Justice Gorsuch Tenth Circuit Process Case selection Nearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari commonly referred to as cert upon which the court grants a writ of certiorari The court may review via this process any civil or criminal case in the federal courts of appeals It may also review by certiorari a final judgment of the highest court of a state if the judgment involves a question of federal statutory or constitutional law A case may alternatively come before the court as a direct appeal from a three judge federal district court The party that petitions the court for review is the petitioner and the non mover is the respondent Case names before the court are styled petitioner v respondent regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court For example criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual as in State of Arizona v Ernesto Miranda If the defendant is convicted and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes Miranda v Arizona The court also hears questions submitted to it by appeals courts themselves via a process known as certification The Supreme Court relies on the record assembled by lower courts for the facts of a case and deals solely with the question of how the law applies to the facts presented There are however situations where the court has original jurisdiction such as when two states have a dispute against each other or when there is a dispute between the United States and a state In such instances a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly Examples of such cases include United States v Texas a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas and Virginia v Tennessee a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of Georgia v Brailsford parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact Georgia v Brailsford remains the only case in which the court has empaneled a jury in this case a special jury Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in New Jersey v Delaware and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in Kansas v Colorado A cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called conference A conference is a private meeting of the nine justices by themselves the public and the justices clerks are excluded The rule of four permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of certiorari If it is granted the case proceeds to the briefing stage otherwise the case ends Except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the court orders briefing from the respondent the respondent may but is not required to file a response to the cert petition The court grants a petition for cert only for compelling reasons spelled out in the court s Rule 10 Such reasons include Resolving a conflict between circuit courts in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings Resolving an important question of federal law or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the court When a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals lawyers call this situation a circuit split if the court votes to deny a cert petition as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it it does so typically without comment A denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case and the decision of the lower court stands as the case s final ruling To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the court each year of the more than 7 000 petitions the court receives each year it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer the court employs an internal case management tool known as the cert pool currently all justices except for Justices Alito and Gorsuch participate in the cert pool Oral argument When the court grants a cert petition the case is set for oral argument Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition With the consent of the parties or approval of the court amici curiae or friends of the court may also file briefs The court holds two week oral argument sessions each month from October through April Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument the court may choose to give more time although this is rare and during that time the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions In 2019 the court adopted a rule generally allowing advocates to speak uninterrupted for the first two minutes of their argument The petitioner gives the first presentation and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent s arguments after the respondent has concluded Amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees The court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case Decision At the conclusion of oral argument the case is submitted for decision Cases are decided by majority vote of the justices After the oral argument is concluded usually in the same week as the case was submitted the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the court sees which side has prevailed One of the justices in the majority is then assigned to write the court s opinion also known as the majority opinion an assignment made by the most senior justice in the majority with the chief justice always being considered the most senior Drafts of the court s opinion circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case Justices are free to change their votes on a case up until the decision is finalized and published In any given case a justice is free to choose whether or not to author an opinion or else simply join the majority or another justice s opinion There are several primary types of opinions Opinion of the court this is the binding decision of the Supreme Court An opinion that more than half of the justices join usually at least five justices since there are nine justices in total but in cases where some justices do not participate it could be fewer is known as majority opinion and creates binding precedent in American law Whereas an opinion that fewer than half of the justices join is known as a plurality opinion and is only partially binding precedent Concurring a justice agrees with and joins the majority opinion but authors a separate concurrence to give additional explanations rationales or commentary Concurrences do not create binding precedent Concurring in the judgment a justice agrees with the outcome the court reached but disagrees with its reasons for doing so A justice in this situation does not join the majority opinion Like regular concurrences these do not create binding precedent Dissent a justice disagrees with the outcome the court reached and its reasoning Justices who dissent from a decision may author their own dissenting opinions or if there are multiple dissenting justices in a decision may join another justice s dissent Dissents do not create binding precedent A justice may also join only part s of a particular decision and may even agree with some parts of the outcome and disagree with others It is the court s practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular term by the end of that term Within that term the court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument Since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the Supreme Court Building the delivery of the decision to the media has historically been done via paper copies in what was known as the Running of the Interns However this practice has become pass as the Court now posts electronic copies of the opinions on its website as they are being announced It is possible that through recusals or vacancies the court divides evenly on a case If that occurs then the decision of the court below is affirmed but does not establish binding precedent In effect it results in a return to the status quo ante For a case to be heard there must be a quorum of at least six justices If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the court had been evenly divided For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court the chief justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U S Court of Appeals for a final decision there This has only occurred once in U S history in the case of United States v Alcoa 1945 Published opinions The court s opinions are published in three stages First a slip opinion is made available on the court s web site and through other outlets Next several opinions and lists of the court s orders are bound together in paperback form called a preliminary print of United States Reports the official series of books in which the final version of the court s opinions appears About a year after the preliminary prints are issued a final bound volume of U S Reports is issued by the Reporter of Decisions The individual volumes of U S Reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily As of January 2019 there are Final bound volumes of U S Reports 569 volumes covering cases through June 13 2013 part of the October 2012 term Slip opinions 21 volumes 565 585 for 2011 2017 terms three two part volumes each plus part 1 of volume 586 2018 term As of March 2012 the U S Reports have published a total of 30 161 Supreme Court opinions covering the decisions handed down from February 1790 to March 2012 This figure does not reflect the number of cases the court has taken up as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion see for example Parents v Seattle where Meredith v Jefferson County Board of Education was also decided in the same opinion by a similar logic Miranda v Arizona actually decided not only Miranda but also three other cases Vignera v New York Westover v United States and California v Stewart A more unusual example is The Telephone Cases which are a single set of interlinked opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the U S Reports Opinions are also collected and published in two unofficial parallel reporters Supreme Court Reporter published by West now a part of Thomson Reuters and United States Supreme Court Reports Lawyers Edition simply known as Lawyers Edition published by LexisNexis In court documents legal periodicals and other legal media case citations generally contain cites from each of the three reporters for example citation to Citizens United v Federal Election Commission is presented as Citizens United v Federal Election Com n 585 U S 50 130 S Ct 876 175 L Ed 2d 753 2010 with S Ct representing the Supreme Court Reporter and L Ed representing the Lawyers Edition Citations to published opinions Lawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases in the form vol U S page pin year where vol is the volume number page is the page number on which the opinion begins and year is the year in which the case was decided Optionally pin is used to pinpoint to a specific page number within the opinion For instance the citation for Roe v Wade is 410 U S 113 1973 which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of U S Reports For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print the volume and page numbers may be replaced with Supreme Court bar In order to plead before the court an attorney must first be admitted to the court s bar Approximately 4 000 lawyers join the bar each year The bar contains an estimated 230 000 members In reality pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys The rest join for a one time fee of 200 with the court collecting about 750 000 annually Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume They also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument Members of the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court Library Term A term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October and continues until June or early July of the following year Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as sittings and recesses justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings and discuss cases and write opinions during recesses Institutional powers The federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the Constitution The power of judicial review in fact is nowhere mentioned in it Over the ensuing years the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way Nevertheless the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well established precedent Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review in Federalist No 78 Alexander Hamilton wrote A Constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning and the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two that which has the superior obligation and validity ought of course to be preferred or in other words the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute The Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in Marbury v Madison 1803 consummating the American system of checks and balances In explaining the power of judicial review Chief Justice John Marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts part of the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is His contention was not that the court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary as well as the other branches of government to read and obey the dictates of the Constitution Since the founding of the republic there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of egalitarianism self government self determination and freedom of conscience At one pole are those who view the federal judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being the most separated and least checked of all branches of government Indeed federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure during good behavior and their pay may not be diminished while they hold their position Section 1 of Article Three Although subject to the process of impeachment only one justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court justice has been removed from office At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government Constraints The Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings instead it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832 when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court s decision in Worcester v Georgia President Andrew Jackson who sided with the Georgia courts is supposed to have remarked John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v Board of Education More recently many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the court s order in United States v Nixon 1974 to surrender the Watergate tapes Nixon ultimately complied with the Supreme Court s ruling Supreme Court decisions can be purposefully overturned by constitutional amendment something that has happened on six occasions Chisholm v Georgia 1793 overturned by the Eleventh Amendment 1795 Dred Scott v Sandford 1857 overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment 1865 and the Fourteenth Amendment 1868 Pollock v Farmers Loan Trust Co 1895 overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment 1913 Minor v Happersett 1875 overturned by the Nineteenth Amendment 1920 Breedlove v Suttles 1937 overturned by the Twenty fourth Amendment 1964 Oregon v Mitchell 1970 overturned by the Twenty sixth Amendment 1971 When the court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the Constitution simple legislative action can reverse the decisions for example in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 superseding the limitations given in Ledbetter v Goodyear Tire Rubber Co in 2007 Also the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional consideration lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations as do law enforcement officials In addition the other two branches can restrain the court through other mechanisms Congress can increase the number of justices giving the president power to influence future decisions by appointments as in Roosevelt s Court Packing Plan discussed above Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases this is suggested by language in Section 2 of Article Three where the appellate jurisdiction is granted with such Exceptions and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make The court sanctioned such congressional action in the Reconstruction Era case ex parte McCardle 1869 although it rejected Congress power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in United States v Klein 1871 On the other hand through its power of judicial review the Supreme Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government for example in United States v Curtiss Wright Export Corp 1936 Dames Moore v Regan 1981 and notably in Goldwater v Carter 1979 which effectively gave the presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress The court s decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority as in Humphrey s Executor v United States 1935 the Steel Seizure Case 1952 and United States v Nixon 1974 Law clerks Each Supreme Court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions for writ of certiorari research them prepare bench memorandums and draft opinions Associate justices are allowed four clerks The chief justice is allowed five clerks but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four Generally law clerks serve a term of one to two years The first law clerk was hired by Associate Justice Horace Gray in 1882 Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr and Louis Brandeis were the first Supreme Court justices to use recent law school graduates as clerks rather than hiring a stenographer secretary Most law clerks are recent law school graduates The first female clerk was Lucile Lomen hired in 1944 by Justice William O Douglas The first African American William T Coleman Jr was hired in 1948 by Justice Felix Frankfurter A disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees from elite law schools especially Harvard Yale the University of Chicago Columbia and Stanford From 1882 to 1940 62 of law clerks were graduates of Harvard Law School Those chosen to be Supreme Court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class and were often an editor of the law review or a member of the moot court board By the mid 1970s clerking previously for a judge in a federal court of appeals had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a Supreme Court justice Ten Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices Byron White for Frederick M Vinson John Paul Stevens for Wiley Rutledge William Rehnquist for Robert H Jackson Stephen Breyer for Arthur Goldberg John Roberts for William Rehnquist Elena Kagan for Thurgood Marshall Neil Gorsuch for both Byron White and Anthony Kennedy Brett Kavanaugh also for Kennedy Amy Coney Barrett for Antonin Scalia and Ketanji Brown Jackson for Stephen Breyer Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh served under Kennedy during the same term Gorsuch is the first justice to clerk for and subsequently serve alongside the same justice serving alongside Kennedy from April 2017 through Kennedy s retirement in 2018 With the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh for the first time a majority of the Supreme Court was composed of former Supreme Court law clerks Roberts Breyer Kagan Gorsuch and Kavanaugh now joined by Barrett and Jackson Several current Supreme Court justices have also clerked in the federal courts of appeals John Roberts for Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Justice Samuel Alito for Judge Leonard I Garth of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Elena Kagan for Judge Abner J Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Neil Gorsuch for Judge David B Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Brett Kavanaugh for Judge Walter Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Amy Coney Barrett for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U S Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit Politicization of the court Clerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School As law has moved closer to mere politics political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts former federal court of appeals judge J Michael Luttig said David J Garrow professor of history at the University of Cambridge stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives Professor Garrow said Each side is putting forward only ideological purists According to the Vanderbilt Law Review study this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law Criticism and controversies Unlike in most high courts the United States Supreme Court has lifetime tenure an unusual amount of power over elected branches of government and a difficult constitution to amend These among other factors have been attributed by some critics to the Court s diminished stature abroad and lower approval ratings at home which have dropped from the mid 60s in the late 1980s to around 40 in the early 2020s Additional factors cited by critics include the polarization of national politics ethics scandals and specific controversial partisan rulings including the relaxation of campaign finance rules weakened voting rights Dobbs v Jackson and Bush v Gore Other controversies include the selection and composition of justices on the court and a lack of transparency in court decisions Approval ratings The Supreme Court has historically been one of few political institutions that have consistently been respected by Democrats and Republicans alike Public trust in the court peaked in the late 1990s Since the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v Wade and permitted states to restrict abortion rights Democrats and independents have increasingly lost trust in the court seen the court as political and expressed support for reforming the institution After recording recent high approval ratings in the late 1980s around 66 approval the court s ratings have declined to an average of around 40 between mid 2021 and February 2024 Composition and selection The electoral college which elects the President who nominates the justices and the US Senate which confirms the justices have selection biases that favor rural states that tend to vote Republican resulting in a conservative Supreme Court Ziblatt and Levitsky estimate that 3 or 4 of the seats held by conservative justices on the court would be held by justices appointed by a Democratic president if the Presidency and Senate were selected directly by the popular vote The three Trump appointees to the court were all nominated by a president who finished second in the popular vote and confirmed by Senators representing a minority of Americans In addition Clarence Thomas confirmation and Merrick Garland s blocked confirmation in 2016 were both decided by Senators representing a minority of Americans Greg Price also critiqued the Court as minority rule Moreover the Federalist Society acted as a filter for judicial nominations during the Trump administration ensuring the latest conservative justices lean even further to the right 86 of judges Trump appointed to circuit courts and the Supreme Court were Federalist Society members David Litt critiques it as an attempt to impose rigid ideological dogma on a profession once known for intellectual freedom The 2016 stonewalling of Merrick Garland s confirmation and subsequent filling with Neil Gorsuch has been critiqued as a stolen seat citing precedent from the 20th century of confirmations during election years while proponents cited three blocked nominations between 1844 and 1866 In recent years Democrats have accused Republican leaders such as Mitch McConnell of hypocrisy as they were instrumental in blocking the nomination of Merrick Garland but then rushed through the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett even though both vacancies occurred close to an election Ethics Ethical controversies have grown with reports of justices and their close family members accepting expensive gifts travel business deals and speaking fees without oversight or recusals from cases that present conflicts of interest Spousal income and connections to cases has been redacted from the Justices ethical disclosure forms while justices such as Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas failed to disclose many large financial gifts including free vacations valued at as much as 500 000 On November 13 2023 the court issued its first ever Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States to set ethics rules and principles that guide the conduct of the Members of the Court The Code has generally been received as a significant first step but also as a measure that does not address the ethics concerns of many notable critics who found the Code relatively weaker than those for federal judges the legislature and the executive branch while also lacking an enforcement mechanism The Code s commentary denied past wrongdoing by saying that the Justices have largely abided by these principles and are simply publishing them now This has prompted some criticism that the court hopes to legitimize past and future scandals through this Code Lack of accountability The ethics rules guiding the court s members are set and enforced by the justices meaning the members of the court have no external checks on their behavior other than the impeachment of a justice by Congress Chief Justice Roberts refused to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April 2023 reasserting his desire for the Supreme Court to continue to monitor itself despite mounting ethics scandals Lower courts by contrast discipline according to the 1973 Code of Conduct for U S judges which is enforced by the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 Article III Section I of the Constitution of the United States 1776 establishes that the justices hold their office during good behavior Thus far only one justice Associate Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 has ever been impeached yet none have ever been removed from office The lack of external enforcement of ethics or other conduct violations makes the Supreme Court an outlier in modern organizational best practices Individual rights Some of the most notable historical decisions that were criticized for failing to protect individual rights include the Dred Scott 1857 decision that upheld slavery with Chief Justice Taney stating in his opinion that African Americans had no rights which the white man was bound to respect Another is Plessy v Ferguson 1896 that upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal In addition the Civil Rights Cases 1883 and Slaughter House Cases 1873 all but eviscerated civil rights legislation enacted during the Reconstruction era and thereby paving the road for Jim Crow laws However others argue that the court is too protective of some individual rights particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention For example Chief Justice Warren Burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule and Justice Scalia criticized the court s decision in Boumediene v Bush for being too protective of the rights of Guantanamo detainees on the grounds that habeas corpus should be limited to sovereign territory After Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization overturned nearly 50 years of precedent set by Roe v Wade some experts expressed concern that this may be the beginning of a rollback of individual rights that had been previously established under the Substantive due process principle in part because Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in Dobbs that the decision should prompt the court to reconsider all of the court s past substantive due process decisions Due process rights claimed to be at risk are The right to privacy including a right to contraceptives Established in Griswold v Connecticut 1965 The right to privacy with regard to private sexual acts Established in Lawrence v Texas 2003 The right to marry an individual of the same sex Established in Obergefell v Hodges 2015 Some experts such as Melissa Murray law professor at N Y U School of Law have claimed that protections for interracial marriage established in Loving v Virginia 1967 may also be at risk Although other experts such as Josh Blackman a law professor at South Texas College of Law have countered with the claim that Loving relied more heavily upon Equal Protection Clause grounds than substantive due process More consequential than merely Griswold and its progeny however is the fact that substantive due process has been the primary vehicle used by the Supreme Court to incorporate the Bill of Rights against state and local governments Indeed Associate Justice Clarence Thomas does not believe in substantive due process and has referred to it as legal fiction Instead Thomas has argued that the Privileges or Immunities Clause is a sounder vehicle for incorporating the Bill of Rights Unfortunately for Thomas outside of Associate Justice Gorsuch s commentary in Timbs v Indiana he has received little support for this viewpoint Judicial activism The Supreme Court is sometimes criticized for engaging in judicial activism This criticism is leveled by those who believe the court should not interpret the law in any way besides through the lens of past precedent or Textualism However those on both sides of the political aisle often level this accusation at the court The debate around judicial activism typically involves accusing the other side of activism whilst denying that your own side engages in it Conservatives often cite the decision in Roe v Wade 1973 as an example of liberal Judicial activism In its decision the court legalized abortion on the basis of a right to privacy that they found inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a reasoning that some conservative critics argued was circuitous Roe v Wade was overturned nearly fifty years later by Dobbs v Jackson 2022 ending the recognition of abortion access as a constitutional right and returning the issue of abortion back to the states David Litt criticized the decision in Dobbs as activism on the part of the court s conservative majority because the court failed to respect past precedent eschewing the principle of Stare decisis that usually guides the court s decisions Reaction to the two cases illustrates how both sides often accuse the other of engaging in Judicial activism The decision in Brown v Board of Education which banned racial segregation in public schools was criticized as activist by conservatives Pat Buchanan Robert Bork and Barry Goldwater More recently Citizens United v Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v Bellotti 1978 that the First Amendment applies to corporations Some experts criticize the complaint of judicial activism with Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy saying that An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don t like Outdated and an outlier Colm Quinn says that a criticism leveled at the court as well as other American institutions is that after two centuries they are beginning to look their age He cites four features of the United States Supreme Court that make it different from high courts in other countries that help explain why polarization is an issue in the United States court It is high profile the high court in the United States is one of the few courts in the world that can unilaterally strike down legislation passed by other politically accountable branches The United States Constitution is very difficult to amend other countries allow for constitutional changes via referendum or with a supermajority in the legislature The United States Supreme Court has a politicized nominating process The United States Supreme Court lacks term limits or mandatory retirements Power Michael Waldman argued that no other country gives its Supreme Court as much power Warren E Burger before becoming Chief Justice argued that since the Supreme Court has such unreviewable power it is likely to self indulge itself and unlikely to engage in dispassionate analysis Larry Sabato wrote that the federal courts and especially the Supreme Court have excessive power Some members of Congress considered the results from the 2021 2022 term a shift of government power into the Supreme Court and a judicial coup The 2021 2022 term of the court was the first full term following the appointment of three judges by Republican president Donald Trump Neil Gorsuch Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett which created a six strong conservative majority on the court Subsequently at the end of the term the court issued a number of decisions that favored this conservative majority while significantly changing the landscape with respect to rights These included Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization which overturned Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey in recognizing abortion is not a constitutional right New York State Rifle Pistol Association Inc v Bruen which made public possession of guns a protected right under the Second Amendment Carson v Makin and Kennedy v Bremerton School District which both weakened the Establishment Clause separating church and state and West Virginia v EPA which weakened the power of executive branch agencies to interpret their congressional mandate This criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism George Will wrote that the court has an increasingly central role in American governance Federalism debate There has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power While Framers such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton argued in The Federalist Papers that their then proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers wishes The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly grants powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people The court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce For example the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act thus protecting six endemic species of insect near Austin Texas despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005 Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress s power over interstate commerce was complete in itself may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution Justice Alito said congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is quite broad modern day theorist Robert B Reich suggests debate over the Commerce Clause continues today Advocates of states rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have also criticized the court saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority Justice Brandeis in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy One critic wrote the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state not federal law Others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a positive force that extends protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level More recently the issue of federal power is central in the prosecution of Gamble v United States which is examining the doctrine of separate sovereigns whereby a criminal defendant can be prosecuted by a state court and then by a federal court Ruling on political questions Some Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena and deciding questions that are the purview of the elected branches of government The Bush v Gore decision in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election awarding George W Bush the presidency over Al Gore received scrutiny as political based on the controversial justifications used by the 5 conservative justices to elevate a fellow conservative to the presidency Democratic backsliding Thomas Keck argues that because the Court has historically not served as a strong bulwark for democracy the Roberts Court has the opportunity to go down in history as a defender of democracy However he believes that if the court shields Trump from criminal prosecution after ensuring his access to the ballot then the risks that come with an anti democratic status quo of the current court will outweigh the dangers that come from court reform including court packing Aziz Z Huq points to the blocking progress of democratizing institutions increasing the disparity in wealth and power and empowering an authoritarian white nationalist movement as evidence that the Supreme Court has created a permanent minority incapable of democratic defeat Secretive proceedings The court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view For example the increasing use of a shadow docket facilitates the court making decisions in secret without knowing how each Justice came to their decision In 2024 after comparing the analysis of shadow docket decisions to Kremlinology Matt Ford called this trend of secrecy increasingly troubling arguing the court s power comes entirely from persuasion and explanation A 2007 review of Jeffrey Toobin s book compared the Court to a cartel where its inner workings are mostly unknown arguing this lack of transparency reduces scrutiny which hurts ordinary Americans who know little about the nine extremely consequential Justices A 2010 poll found that 61 of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would be good for democracy and 50 of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised Too few cases Senator Arlen Specter argued the court should decide more cases Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the court heard then was smaller than when he first joined the Supreme Court but he also stated that he had not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case nor did he believe his colleagues had changed their standards He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s at least in part to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts Too slow British constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts and specifically the Supreme Court act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches he argues that because the courts must wait sometimes for years for cases to navigate their way through the system their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened In contrast various other countries have a dedicated constitutional court that has original jurisdiction on constitutional claims brought by persons or political institutions for example the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany which can declare a law unconstitutional when challenged Waning influence Adam Liptak wrote in 2008 that the court has declined in relevance in other constitutional courts He cites factors like American exceptionalism the relatively few updates to the constitution or the courts the rightward shift of the court and the

                "text": "Congress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court s appellate jurisdiction The Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states but may decline to hear such cases It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors other public ministers consuls or vice consuls of foreign states are parties all controversies between the United States and a State and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens In 1906 the court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for contempt of court in United States v Shipp The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the court s history The contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of Ed Johnson in Chattanooga Tennessee the evening after Justice John Marshall Harlan granted Johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal Johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded and hanged from a bridge after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on Johnson s body reading To Justice Harlan Come get your nigger now The local sheriff John Shipp cited the Supreme Court s intervention as the rationale for the lynching The court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in Washington before the Supreme Court justices who found nine individuals guilty of contempt sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail In all other cases the court has only appellate jurisdiction including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal In practice the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the court are disputes between two or more states The court s appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal through certiorari certiorari before judgment and certified questions the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces through certiorari the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico through certiorari the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands through certiorari the District of Columbia Court of Appeals through certiorari and final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had through certiorari In the last case an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state s highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal For example a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U S Supreme Court if a the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant certiorari e g Florida Star v B J F or b the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court s decision without discussing the merits of the case since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts rather than just federal courts was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the court s history by its rulings in Martin v Hunter s Lessee 1816 and Cohens v Virginia 1821 The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions although there are several devices that permit so called collateral review of state cases It has to be noted that this collateral review often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system Since Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain cases or controversies the Supreme Court cannot decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions as the supreme courts of some states may do For example in DeFunis v Odegaard 1974 the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered However the court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot If an issue is capable of repetition yet evading review the court would address it even though the party before the court would not themselves be made whole by a favorable result In Roe v Wade 1973 and other abortion cases the court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct in which the court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff s need for relief ",

    "Washington Blade": {
        "text": "The Washington Blade is an LGBT newspaper in the Washington metropolitan area The Blade is the oldest LGBT newspaper in the United States and third largest by circulation behind the Philadelphia Gay News and the Gay City News of New York City The Blade is often referred to as America s gay newspaper of record because it chronicled LGBT news locally nationally and internationally The New York Times said the Blade is considered one of the most influential publications written for a gay audience The paper was originally launched as an independent publication in October 1969 with a focus on bringing the community together In 2001 the Blade was purchased by Window Media LLC a group of gay oriented newspapers circulated throughout the United States with a staff composed of professional journalists becoming a leading source of news for the readers both in Washington and around the nation The paper publishes weekly on Fridays and celebrated its 50th anniversary in October 2019 In November 2009 the Blade and several related publications including the Southern Voice were shut down after Window Media announced it was closing business After Blade staff members were told they no longer had jobs plans were made for a new gay publication entitled DC Agenda since the trademark for Washington Blade was still held by the now defunct Window Media It was announced on April 27 2010 that the DC Agenda would rename itself to the Washington Blade The ownership group of the Agenda consisted of many former staff members of the Blade who purchased the trademark and paper archives out of bankruptcy court The first issue of the newly independent Blade debuted on April 30 2010 History Origins to 1973 The Washington Blade originally called The Gay Blade published its first issue on October 5 1969 Taking its roots from the Mattachine Society of Washington s newsletter in the late 1950s and early 1960s the Blade was conceived as a way to fill in a perceived gap in the organization of social communications within the gay community of Washington D C It was created by Nancy Tucker and Lilli Vincenz The Blade was originally published as a single page and distributed hand to hand in a variety of gay bars throughout the city Afraid of a backlash over the publication many of the initial authors of writings in the Blade used pen names during the early years of publishing The initial publications were entirely created by volunteers from the community with two editors Nancy Tucker and Bart Wenger at the helm Wenger stated the initial goals of the publication were to engender a sense of community and that it was very important for gays to become acquainted with one another Published monthly from 1969 to 1973 the newspaper evolved from its original size and shape of a single letter sized paper sheet In June 1972 the Gay Blade published its first multi page edition which consisted of four pages and in April 1973 the paper expanded to eight pages and was printed on legal sized paper sheets stapled in the middle and folded As the looks of the paper evolved so did the news coverage The Gay Blade began to focus less on being a newsletter used to organize the community and more of a newspaper for the community 1974 to 1982 In July 1974 the first newsprint edition was published and signaled an evolution in the history of the Gay Blade A fifth anniversary edition of the paper was not published in October 1974 because of a lack of revenue and interest marking the only time the paper failed to publish an edition in its history The new focus on being a newspaper allowed the publication s circulation to grow in 1974 and 1975 from five hundred copies distributed at less than a dozen sites to over 4 000 copies available at thirty five locations throughout the city The June 1975 edition of the Blade dropped the word Gay from the title of the publication after it was discovered that a newspaper in New York City held the rights to the name Gay Blade The new name of the publication was now The Blade It continued to be published on newsprint paper and had no additional format changes until near the end of the decade Incorporating as a non profit corporation under the title of Blade Communications Inc in November 1975 the paper continued its growth Don Michaels an important voice on the pages of the publication was named the editor of the paper in January 1978 Michaels began strict enforcement of a policy that prohibited pen names from being used in bylines By November 1978 the Blade was regularly featuring color printing on its pages and beginning in 1979 the Blade changed into a bi weekly publication Starting in October 1980 the name of the publication changed to The Washington Blade and the corporation re incorporated as a for profit employee owned business In July 1981 the Blade ran a front page story entitled Rare Fatal Pneumonia Hits Gay Men making the paper one of the first gay newspapers in the country to write about the disease that has come to be known as AIDS In November 1981 Don Michaels got promoted to the position of publisher a position he would hold for over two decades 1983 to 2000 The Blade started publishing weekly in January 1983 and coverage shifted to the AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease The ever breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources with members of the community having to step in to support the work of the Blade The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today In June 1988 the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade In April 1993 during the 1993 Gay March on Washington the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York called the New York Blade In the later part of the century coverage was expanded to include local and national news as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community Some authors implemented the use of humor in addressing potentially sensitive subjects such as N Leigh Dunlap in her long running comic strip Morgan Calabrese 2001 to 2010 On May 25 2001 the print edition announced the sale of the Washington Blade to Window Media LLC a group of gay publications With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades Shortly after the sale of the paper staff at the Blade sought a vote to unionize with the help of the Washington Baltimore Newspaper Guild The Guild and the staff of the Blade brought a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board and deliberated for a few weeks over this issue resulting in a ten to eight vote against unionization on July 20 2001 Beginning in 2005 the Washington Blade also ran a free news clipping service called the BladeWire This service collected news stories of interest to the LGBT community from a variety of local state regional national and selected international media sources The service was generated by the Blades editors and was published on the internet A feature of the BladeWire also allowed it to be syndicated onto other websites using JavaScript During the 2008 U S presidential election Senator John McCain s decision to participate in a written interview with the Blade marked the first time a Republican presidential nominee agreed to be interviewed by a gay publication On November 16 2009 the paper was abruptly shut down because of the financial status of its parent company Window Media and its majority shareholder Avalon Equity Partners Employees at the Blade were aware of Window Media s financial troubles but the timing and total closure of the publication came as a shock to the entire staff Kevin Naff editor of the Blade said employees found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for us when we got to work this morning Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper and because the debt ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication s finances the same day the Blade shut down Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers We re all together Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a weekly must read and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington s LGBT community On November 20 2009 a new venture supported entirely by volunteering staff who consisted of the majority of the Blade s editorial staff as well as a few others at the time of its closing launched with its first issue Called DC Agenda no relation to the non profit organization of the same name the new venture released the same week as the closing of the Blade From the placeholder website SaveTheBlade com While we cannot save the name we can certainly save all that was the essence and spirit of our LGBTQ Community s newspaper of record The staff of the paper remains united and our mission to enlighten and inform remains steadfast We will launch a new publication that will bring you what we have always worked to deliver gay news and information that is critical to our Metro DC LGBTQ Community Issues were handed out at Washington D C Metro train stations and an online copy was available at www washingtonblade com On February 25 2010 DC Agenda acquired the assets of the Washington Blade from the US Bankruptcy Court Included were the archives name trademarks website and fixtures from the Washington Blade offices About a month later on April 26 2010 the DC Agenda publisher announced that the Washington Blade name would return to the masthead of the paper with the DC Agenda becoming the name of the arts and entertainment section On March 24 2017 the paper launched a version in Los Angeles called the Los Angeles Blade Circulation and demographics The Washington Blade was published weekly on Fridays with a circulation of 33 874 printed copies of each edition News coverage focuses mainly on global and regional political issues concerning LGBT persons with additional coverage of entertainment and nightlife in the Washington D C area The masthead of the printed paper includes the slogan The gay and lesbian weekly of the national capital area since 1969 and the online masthead proclaims All the news for your life And your style Distribution of the Blade includes locations throughout the Washington D C area Additional distribution points are located in Maryland Virginia and as far away as Rehoboth Beach Delaware The newspaper is primarily distributed through free standing newspaper boxes on street corners newspaper racks at Metro stations and in shops and restaurants The main competition to the Washington Blade in Washington D C is the weekly newsmagazine Metro Weekly and nationally the Bay Area Reporter of San Francisco For a brief period starting in 1979 the Blade also had competition from Blacklight the city s first African American gay monthly periodical Archives of the Washington Blade were maintained at their Washington D C offices and on Microfilm at the Microfilm Reading Room of the Library of Congress and in the Alternative Underground Press Collections of ProQuest formerly called UMI in Ann Arbor Michigan The newspaper is a member of the National Newspaper Association the National Gay Newspaper Guild and the Associated Press According to a survey conducted by Simmons Market Research in April 2000 for the Washington Blade the median age of their readership was forty one and 85 of their readers were between the ages of twenty five and fifty four years old 92 of the readership is employed with 70 of the readers in professional and managerial jobs The median income of readers was 57 200 per year with median household income at 84 000 Overall 79 of the Blade s readership holds a college degree with 42 of the readers holding postgraduate degrees Awards A series of articles from March 1985 and continuing for five months entitled When Pretending Stops written by Lisa Keen won local acclaim and awards for the coverage of the slow death of local lawyer Ray Engebretsen This series of articles chronicled the impact of AIDS in the gay community and was ground breaking coverage in Washington In 1995 the Washington Blade won a Silver Gavel award from the American Bar Association for a four part series of articles entitled Legal Challenges to Anti Gay Initiatives which explored the legal consequences of anti gay ballot initiatives and the constitutional challenges to them In 2007 the paper won four Dateline Awards for Excellence in Local Journalism from the Society of Professional Journalists Washington D C Pro Chapter Criticism and controversy Publication of the paper has not been without controversy over the years The news coverage from the early years to the mid 1980s was perceived by some as being white washed for its lack of coverage of the gay African American population located in Washington D C a city where more than 70 percent of its residents were African American This led to the creation of the short lived publication Blacklight the city s first African American gay monthly periodical in August 1979 which attempted to compete with the Blade Coverage of the City Council special election in April 1991 garnered intensive criticism of biased coverage and led to calls for reforming the paper s editorial board In 1993 the Blade and its publishing company threatened to sue the Fairfax County Library over a potential ban on the distribution of the Blade at its branches Also the 2001 sale of the Washington Blade to Window Media LLC led to intense criticism from former employees editors and media pundits of the consolidation of so many gay newspapers editorial boards into the same company leading to fears of homogenizing of content and editorial control A former staff writer has also accused the paper of playing politics through the mandated use of the capitalized version of the word Gay in order to make a political statement The newspaper has been accused from time to time of forcing public figures out of the closet This policy of outing individuals surfaced in 1996 during the debate over the Defense of Marriage Act when the Blade and The Advocate were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley Neither publication did out either politician and both publications later denied ever intending to out the Congressmen In recent years these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff current editor of the Blade has accused The Washington Post of straight washing stories about LGBT individuals Naff wrote that When someone is described as flamboyant eccentric or a lifelong bachelor we know what s being implied Readers of the Washington Post had better hone their gaydar skills because in story after story the newsgathering behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the Blade staff writer Greg Marzullo wrote Why do we insist on mentioning someone s sexual orientation at all Because we re a queer paper As reported in the Washington Post former editor Chris Crain summarized the Blade s editorial reasoning for the outings by stating that It is 2004 not 1954 and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a private fact beyond the pale of inquiry The Blade he wrote would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti gay members of Congress for whom they work A former staff writer of the Washington Blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections In July 2005 Jeff Gannon began writing editorials for the paper His pieces included criticism of gay blogger John Aravosis who had helped uncover Gannon s pornographic ads Editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision due to Gannon s history of anti gay reporting as well as Gannon s refusal to disclose his sexual orientation He has said My personal life is a private matter despite the fact that I have become a public person Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial and claimed the steady stream of feedback vitriol had declined a little with each new Gannon article References External links DC Agenda The website for the new publication DC Agenda that was created by former Blade staff Save The

online presence A new layout for the print edition accompanied an online redesign and new editorial strategy Former editor Matt Comer wrote With our change in aesthetics comes a change in our editorial direction Our bi weekly print issues will be more future oriented and contain less reporting of events past while GoQnotes com takes up a more robust daily presence with online only reporting of Carolinas national and international events and news In an effort to maintain our new robust website and editorial direction qnotes will be implementing a sort of web first model Stories slated to appear in our print editions will be published as they are completed or as a set of stories in the day or two after we dispatch our content to our printer No more waiting the painfully slow and long five days between press time and street date Staff Publisher Jim Yarbrough Oversees daily operation of all aspects of the newspaper from financial matters to employment and occasional

        "text": "The Piedmont also known as the Piedmont Service is a regional passenger train operated by Amtrak and the North Carolina Department of Transportation NCDOT running four round trips daily between Raleigh and Charlotte North Carolina It is a sister train to the Carolinian which runs from Charlotte to New York City The Piedmont route is coextensive with the far southern leg of the Carolinian largely paralleling Interstate 85 It operates along the far western leg of the state owned North Carolina Railroad which runs from Charlotte to Morehead City Operations began in May 1995 NCDOT owns the rolling stock used on the Piedmont unlike the Carolinian which uses Amtrak rolling stock Both trains are marketed by NCDOT under the NC By Train brand In fiscal year 2023 Piedmont carried 289 955 passengers a 36 4 increase from FY2022 This is an increase from pre COVID 19 pandemic ridership with 214 218 passengers carried in FY2019 History North Carolina developed the Piedmont as a regional follow on to the Carolinian which had entered service in early 1990 With the growing popularity of the Carolinian state officials sought to add a second daily round trip between Charlotte and Raleigh However Amtrak initially balked claiming that it didn t have enough rolling stock to spare Undaunted in the fall of 1990 NCDOT approved the acquisition of five used passenger cars and the leasing of two diesel locomotives The board planned to have the second train enter service by early 1992 The Piedmont as the train came to be called faced numerous delays Since the Charlotte station was not designed to turn equipment Norfolk Southern which operates the NCRR under a longstanding lease with the state insisted that the state construct a wye in Charlotte for turning the two trains around At the time the southbound Carolinian had deadheaded 10 miles 16 km south to the nearest wye in Pineville and turned around there In 1993 the cost of the wye plus land purchase was estimated at 200 000 by late 1994 this grew to 695 000 plus 1 5 million for a maintenance facility in Raleigh The Piedmont finally began operating on May 26 1995 Originally it operated with an early morning trip to Charlotte and a nighttime return to Raleigh Its creation enabled same day business travel between Charlotte and Raleigh in both directions After delays in refurbishing the motive power and passenger cars an additional Piedmont round trip began operating on June 5 2010 With the addition of the second train Amtrak rebranded the route Piedmont Service to reflect the multiple daily frequencies On March 22 2011 it was announced that an agreement between NCDOT Amtrak Norfolk Southern and the North Carolina Railroad had been reached that would allow for 461 million in grants from the federal government to be used in upgrading infrastructure The money would be used to add additional double track and passing sidings as well as reducing curves resulting in a 13 minute reduction in travel time Improvements include the new Raleigh Union Station which had its ribbon cutting in late April 2018 and began accepting trains that July A third daily Piedmont round trip was added on June 4 2018 On April 6 2020 the Piedmont was truncated to a single round trip due to the COVID 19 pandemic On May 18 2020 the Piedmont was suspended in a further round of COVID related service cutbacks This left the Carolinian which returned that day after a month long suspension as the only rail link between Charlotte and Raleigh The Piedmont returned on August 10 with a single round trip A second round trip was restored in December On April 5 2021 the Piedmont resumed its full schedule of three round trips This was part of a planned larger restoration of service across the Amtrak system in the spring and summer of 2021 A fourth round trip was added on July 10 2023 On May 27 2021 Amtrak released a long range planning document for improved service in the Southeast Region that proposed additional Piedmont frequencies between Charlotte and Raleigh as well as a potential expansion of two round trips south to Atlanta Georgia along the route of the Crescent If implemented an additional round trip along this corridor would operate only between Charlotte and Atlanta Expanding the Piedmont route to Atlanta would create the first daylight service south of Charlotte in the Amtrak era After the federal government awarded the NCDOT a 1 1 billion dollar grant in December 2023 NCDOT said that the Piedmont route would be extended from Raleigh to Wake Forest North Carolina NCDOT targeted 2030 for the completion of infrastructure improvements to support this plan Route details The Piedmont operates over North Carolina Railroad trackage Norfolk Southern Railway and its

The state sets schedules owns the equipment and handles most of the marketing Maintenance is handled by state contractors at facilities in Charlotte and Raleigh Rolling stock The motive power for the

horn were scrapped Since at least 2017 the Piedmont has operated with two locomotives one on each end of the train to improve on time performance With the addition of the cab control units the Piedmont also operates in push pull mode with a single locomotive State owned passenger cars on the Piedmont are refurbished coach cars originally built by Pullman Standard and the St Louis Car Company in the 1960s for the Kansas City Southern and Union Pacific There are five lounge baggage cars and one coach baggage car originally built by the St Louis Car Company in the 1950s and used by the United States Army The lounge car includes vending machines and complimentary coffee and tea There are 14 regular coaches used on trains in addition to the six lounge baggage cars Each coach is named after a state landmark or state symbol including Albemarle Sound Bogue Sound Box Turtle Cardinal Carolina Lily Core Sound Currituck Sound Dogwood Emerald Fraser Fir Granite Gray Squirrel Honey Bee Long Leaf Pine Plott Hound Scotch Bonnet and Sweet Potato During the COVID related service cutbacks of 2020 NCDOT opted to run the Carolinian rather than the Piedmont to save the expense of maintaining the state owned consists since the Carolinian uses Amtrak rolling stock All rolling stock has been painted in a blue and silver livery with red accents based on the North Carolina state flag The Carolinian uses Amtrak s national red white blue livery In August 2019 the Federal Railroad Administration awarded NCDOT up to 76 9 million to purchase 13 new coaches allowing the replacement of some older cars and an expansion to four daily round trips On May 22 2020 Senator Thom Tillis announced that NCDOT will receive an 80 million dollar grant to order 13 additional new railcars for an overall total of 26 new railcars and 6 new locomotives to replace the remainder of the current fleet By February 2020 nine former circus train cars purchased by NCDOT for 383 000 in 2017 for restoration and use on the Piedmont were stored in Spring Hope North Carolina The state listed the nine cars for sale in December 2020 The cars were not sold they were damaged by fire on March 10 2022

    "Livery": {
        "text": "A livery is an identifying design such as a uniform ornament symbol or insignia that designates ownership or affiliation often found on an individual or vehicle Livery often includes elements of the heraldry relating to the individual or corporate body featured in the livery Alternatively some kind of a personal emblem or badge or a distinctive colour is featured The word itself derives from the French livr e meaning dispensed handed over Most often it would indicate that the wearer of the livery was a servant dependant follower or friend of the owner of the livery or in the case of objects that the object belonged to them In the late medieval phenomenon of bastard feudalism livery badges worn by the retainers of great lords sometimes in effect private armies became a great political concern in England Etymology In the Black Book of 1483 it was laid down that each person should receive for his Livery at night half a chet loaf one quart of wine one gallon of ale and for Winter livery one percher wax one candle wax Edmund Spenser noted in 1596 that the liverye is sayd to be served up all night that is theyr nyghtes allowances of drinks In the early inventories of households in the chambers there are a large number of Livery Cupboards recorded presumably used for storing the Livery During the 12th century specific colours denoting a great person began to be used for both his soldiers and his civilian followers the two often overlapped considerably and the modern sense of the term began to form Usually two different colours were used together and often with a device or badge sewn on but the ways in which they were combined varied with rank Often the colours used were different each year In addition to embroidered badges metal ones were sewn on to clothing or hung on neck chains or by far the most prestigious livery collars From the 16th century onwards only the lower status followers tended to receive clothes in livery colours whilst the higher status ones received cash and the term servant previously much wider also began to be restricted to describing the same people Municipalities and corporations copied the behaviour of the great households The term is also used to describe badges buttons and grander pieces of jewellery containing the heraldic signs of an individual which were given by that person to friends followers and distinguished visitors as well as in more modest forms servants The grandest of these is the livery collar William Lord Hastings the favourite of King Edward IV of England had a Coller of gold of K Edward s lyverys valued at the enormous sum of 40 in an inventory of 1489 This would have been similar to the collars worn by Hastings sister and her husband Sir John Donne in the Donne Triptych by Hans Memling described in Sir John Donne Lords gave their servants lead or pewter badges to sew onto their clothes In the 15th century European royalty sometimes distributed uniform suits of clothes to courtiers as the House of Fugger the leading bankers did to all employees This practice later contracted to the provision of standardized clothing to male servants often in a colour scheme distinctive to a particular family The term most notably referred to the embroidered coats waistcoats knee breeches and stockings in 18th century style worn by footmen on formal occasions in grand houses Plainer clothing in dark colours and without braiding was worn by footmen chauffeurs and other employees for ordinary duties For financial reasons the employment of such servants and their expensive dress died out after World War I except in royal households At European courts Most European royal courts still use their state liveries on formal occasions These are generally in traditional national colours and are based on 18th century clothing with fine gold embroidery Only male royal servants normally wear livery Knee breeches are worn normally with white silk stockings one exception being the Spanish court which prescribes red United Kingdom At the British royal court scarlet state livery is still worn by footmen coachmen and other attendants on state occasions The full dress scarlet coats are handmade and embroidered in gold braid with the royal cypher of the monarch Gold buttons and other trimmings are of designs and patterns which date from the 18th century and the full state dress worn by footmen includes scarlet breeches stockings and a sword On other formal occasions a semi state dress is worn a scarlet tail coat black trousers and a white stiff shirt and bow tie Normal day to day dress as worn by footmen on duty in the palace except on special occasions consists of a black tail coat and trousers white shirt and black tie and a scarlet waistcoat with gold trimming Pages wear similar daily semi state and very occasionally state liveries but in dark blue rather than scarlet The uniform clothing issued to full time royal staff is tailor made but the seldom worn full state dress is not bespoke the usual practice is to select individuals whose height fits the existing ceremonial coats held in storage Pages of Honour to the king wear scarlet or in Scotland green frock coats with blue velvet cuffs edged all round with gold lace with white breeches and hose a short sword and other accoutrements Scarlet is the livery colour of the sovereign and of the royal court Elizabeth II also had a family livery colour however known as Edinburgh Green which she and the Duke of Edinburgh chose in the year of their marriage 1948 Five years later at her coronation while the Queen s attendants wore scarlet the page in attendance on the Duke wore a green livery edged in silver Subsequently Edinburgh green became the colour used for their private cars and carriages whereas the official vehicles are painted in a royal livery colour of maroon or claret and black Belgium At the Belgian court liveries in traditional colours are still used at state occasions The coats are red and have black cuffs with golden lace Royal cyphers are embroidered on the shoulders The breeches are of yellow fabric The semi state livery worn for less formal occasions has black breeches The Netherlands At the Dutch court the full state livery is blue nassaublauw The breeches are yellow and cuffs are red Sue one s livery The phrase to sue one s livery refers to the formal recognition of a noble s majority in exchange of payment for conferring the powers attached to his title and thereby freeing him from dependence as a ward Modern usage From this core meaning multiple extended or specialist meanings have derived mostly related to exterior graphic designs on vehicles Examples include A livery company is the name used for a guild in the City of London members of the company were allowed to dress their servants in the distinctive uniform of their trade and the company s charters enabled them to prevent others from embarking upon the trades within the company s jurisdiction A fleet livery is the common design and paint scheme a business or organization uses on its fleet vehicles often using specific colors and logo placement For example the United Parcel Service has trucks with a well known brown livery This may sometimes used alongside wrap advertising Fleet liveries can be used to promote a brand or for unrelated advertising compared to the goods contained in the vehicle This can enable companies to become iconic as a result of their livery An example is the truck fleet of Eddie Stobart Group which has a deal with Corgi to sell replicas of their trucks with their unique red green and white livery Fleet liveries are also used by emergency services to make emergency vehicles visually distinct from civilian traffic allowing for higher visibility and easy identification Depending on the policies of the agency and the scope of its jurisdiction the livery used by an emergency vehicle fleet may be the same or similar across a

were however regarded as a form of livery the King s coat during the late 17th and early 18th centuries in the European monarchies During this period officers of the French Garde du Corps the Royal

each of these vehicle types the more specific terms automobile sport motorcycle sport power boating and air sports may be used commonly or officially by organisers and governing bodies Different manifestations of motorsport with their own objectives and specific rules are called disciplines Examples include circuit racing rallying and trials Governing bodies also called sanctioning bodies often have general rules for each discipline but allow supplementary rules to define the character of a particular competition series or championship Groups of these are often categorised informally such as by vehicle type surface type or propulsion method Examples of categories within a discipline are formula racing touring car racing sports car racing etc Governing bodies The F d ration Internationale de l Automobile FIA formed in 1904 is the oldest and most prominent international governing body It claims to be the sole international motor sporting authority for automobiles and other land vehicles with four or more wheels whilst acknowledging the authority of the F d ration Internationale de Motocyclisme FIM over vehicles with one to three wheels which FIM calls motorcycle sport FIM and FIA are both recognised as international sports federations by the International Olympic Committee FIA hierarchy Within the FIA s structure each affiliated National Sporting Authority ASN is recognised as the sole authority in their nation Permission of the ASNs must be obtained to organise events using their rules and their licenses must be held by participants Not all ASNs function in the same manner some are private companies such as Motorsport UK some are supported by the state such as France s FFSA or in the case of the US s ACCUS a council of sanctioning bodies is the national representative at FIA meetings ASNs their affiliated clubs or independent commercial promotors organise motorsport events which often include competitions A collective of events is called a series and a grouping of competitions often forms the basis of a championship cup or trophy Unaffiliated automobile sport bodies Not all nations have a sporting authority affiliated with the FIA some disciplines may not fall within the FIA s remit of control or organisations may choose to ignore the claim of the authority of others Examples include banger racing and stock car racing in the United Kingdom which are claimed by both the Oval Racing Council and the National Stock car Association despite the claim by the FIA affiliated ASN Motorsport UK to be the governing body of all four wheel motorsport in the UK SCORE International National Auto Sport Association and National Off Road Racing Association of the United States are also not members of the FIA affiliation system but may work with members for international matters History In 1894 the French newspaper Le Petit Journal organised a contest for horseless carriages featuring a run from Paris to Rouen This is widely accepted as the world s first motorsport event In 1900 the Gordon Bennett Cup was established Closed circuit racing arose as open road racing on public roads was banned Motorsport was a demonstration event at the 1900 Summer Olympics Following World War I European countries organised Grand Prix races over closed courses In the United States dirt track racing became popular After World War II the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised In the United States stock car racing and drag racing became firmly established Disciplines of automobile sport Racing Although English dictionaries do not unanimously agree and singularly define that a race is between competitors running head to head in its International Sporting Code the FIA defines racing as two or more cars competing on the same course simultaneously Circuit racing Circuit racing takes place on sealed surface courses at permanent autodromes or on temporary street circuits Competitors race over a set number of laps of the circuit with the winner being the first to finish or for a set length of time with the winner having completed the highest number of laps with others classified subsequently Circuit racing replaced point to point city to city racing early in the history of motorsport for both spectator appeal and as safety concerns brought in regulation of the sport forcing organisers to use closed marshalled and policed circuits on closed public roads Aspendale Racecourse in Australia in 1906 was the first purpose built motor racing track in the world After which permanent autodromes popularly replaced circuits on public roads In North America the term road racing is used to describe racing and courses that have origins in racing on public highways distinguished from oval racing which has origins at purpose built speedways using concrete or wooden boards Single seater racing involves cars with minimal chassis and bodywork material with capacity only for the driver and necessary mechanical components As the wheels protrude from the body of the car these thorough race cars are also known as open wheel cars Formula racing is an informal collection of series that use a specific set of rules for race car design The most prevalent international series are Formula One and Formula Two Others include Formula 3 Formula Ford Formula Renault and Formula Palmer Audi Former Formula series include Formula 5000 GP2 and GP3 Formula One is an international championship governed by the FIA and currently promoted by the privately owned company Formula One Group The regulations contain a strict set of rules which govern vehicle power weight size and design The rules do allow for some variation however Formula E is a championship of open wheel racing that uses only electric powered cars The series was conceived in 2012 and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014 The series is also sanctioned by the FIA and races a spec chassis battery combination with manufacturers allowed to develop their own electric power trains The series has gained significant traction in recent years IndyCar Series originated on June 12 1909 in Portland Oregon Shortly after Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909 and held races that ranged from 50 to 200 miles 80 to 322 km Its premier race is the Indianapolis 500 which began on May 11 1911 Today IndyCar operates with over 20 teams and 40 different drivers Sports car racing involves two categories One includes production based grand touring GT and sports cars Although these are separate vehicle categories when built for road use and historically they were raced as manufactured these vehicle types have little difference when prepared for modern racing The second category includes racing prototypes thorough closed bodied race cars with wheels enclosed by the bodywork and with the historical connection to a sports car s requirement to have two seats and a minimum width The flagship race is the 24 Hours of Le Mans which takes place annually in France during the month of June It is a constituent race of the FIA World Endurance Championship Stock car racing originally used production stock cars the vehicles are now purpose built prototype sports cars or single seater cars In the most prominent series organised by NASCAR in the US Canada and Brazil amongst others the cars maintain a silhouette body of a production road car Stock car racing series in the UK and New Zealand also use open wheel single seater race cars with little to no bodywork Touring car racing involves modified production cars intended for road use In FIA regulations touring cars must be recognised with having a minimum production quota and have a minimum of four seats although the cars are still heavily modified and prepared for racing Some national bodies accept cars with two seats as touring cars Truck racing involves racing of modified large goods vehicle tractor units Off road racing Off road racing can take place on open terrain with no set path or on circuits that do not have a sealed surface such as asphalt or concrete Notable off road races on open terrain include the Baja 1000 desert race organised by SCORE International The FIA authorise Extreme E an electric off road series whose organisers have announced a hydrogen fuel series Extreme H to begin in 2025 Examples of off road racing disciplines and series include Rallycross short sprint races of touring cars on compact circuits of both asphalt and dirt surfaces The discipline was born in Great Britain in 1967 when some entrants of the cancelled RAC Rally used their rally cars in a televised race instead Lawn mower racing involves the racing of ride on lawnmowers on dirt surfaced circuits or point to point cross country courses The British Lawn Mower Racing Association organises an annual World Championship which consists of one event Autograss a British off road racing series sanctioned by the National Autograss Sport Association Ten classes of various vehicle categories are accepted and races for each class are usually four to ten laps long and have up to eight vehicles competing Drag racing Drag racing is an acceleration contest from a standing start along a short and straight course Vehicles of various types can compete usually between two vehicles Winners can be the first to finish of competing pairs or by setting the fastest time and competitions may have heats and or series of runs Karting Kart racing is a form of circuit racing using very small and low vehicles not considered as automobiles known as go karts It is one of the sports regulated by FIA under the name of CIK permitting licensed competition racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward It is generally accepted as the most economical form of motorsport available on four wheels As a free time activity it can be performed by almost anybody and as karting circuits can be indoors and not take as much space as other forms of motorsport it can be accessible to retail consumers without much qualification or training Hill climbs time trials and sprints Non racing speed competitions have various names but all carry the general rule of participants completing a course individually with the intention of setting the shortest time or highest average speed This form of motorsport can be recreational or when competitive rules may vary slightly such as whether to include the total time of several runs the best time set or the average pace of multiple courses to classify competitors Qualifying sessions for circuit races and special stages in rallying take the general form of time trials and sprints Hillclimbing Hillclimbing is the most widely known form of time trial due to its status as the only time trial or sprint form to have international FIA championships and endorsement Its origins begin near the start of motorsport particularly with the trials held that tested the capabilities of early automobiles to tackle uphill gradients Contestants complete an uphill course individually and against the clock the winner having the shortest lowest average or total time Hillclimbing events often include classes of competition for various categories and ages of vehicle and so may be incorporated into car shows or festivals of motoring such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed Hill climb courses can be short at less than 1 mile or several miles long such as the 12 42 mile Pikes Peak course in Colorado USA Sprints time trials and time attack Sprints are governed by national FIA member ASNs in United Kingdom Ireland and Australia amongst other places They are held on courses that do not climb a hill at private and closed roadways where higher speeds and distances can be reached than at an autotesting course for example Time attack are terms used by series that run sprints at racing circuits where competitors try to set the quickest lap time rather than racing head to head with others Time trials are run by the Sports Car Club of America amongst others Rallysprint Rallysprints are mainly sanctioned and held in continental Europe Ultimately they are similar to other time trial sprints but originate from the cars and courses used in special stage rallying with the elements of navigation and itinerary removed and not necessarily requiring a co driver to call pacenotes Rallying Rallying involves driving to a set itinerary following a prescribed route and arriving and departing at control points at set times with penalties applied for diverging from the route or arriving late and early Rallies nearly always involve routes on open roads closed special stages are used on some rallies where competitors drive against the clock The classification of these rallies are determined by summing the times set with the fastest crews being victorious as found in the World Rally Championship This method is often called rally racing or stage rallying informally whilst rallies that do not include special stages are distinctly regularity rallies Rallies that include routes that cover terrain off road are also known as rally raid or cross country rallies the most famous example being the Dakar Rally In the United States the National Off Road Racing Association NORRA was founded in 1967 along with the Baja 1000 Since the 1990s this race has been organised by SCORE International whilst NORRA s events have closer followed the FIA regulations and standards for cross country rallies although the association has no affiliation to ACCUS the US s FIA member Drifting Drifting is a form of motorsport where drivers intentionally lose rolling traction in corners through oversteering but maintain momentum with effective throttle control clutch use and corrective steering In competition a panel of judges award marks on artistry and car control through the corner or series of corners Competitions often feature pairs of cars driving together where a lead car and a chase car go head to head with only one car going through to the next heat or winning the competition Autocross Autocross has multiple general meanings based on country of use Prescribed by the FIA and in continental European nations is a form of off road racing on short circuits entirely on unsealed surfaces The cars are typically enclosed single seaters called buggies touring cars or tubular chassis cross cars In United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland is an off road time trial over a short temporary course Multiple competitors may be on the course at one time but are not racing head to head In United States and Canada is similar to Autotesting in the United Kingdom and Australia It is a form of low speed time trial on short circuits or courses that are often temporary and reconfigurable allowing for multiple passes of new routes at one compact venue Autotesting Gymkhana Also known as Autocross in US and Canada and Autoslalom in Continental Europe these similar disciplines are held in the United Kingdom Ireland Australia and New Zealand They involve precise car control usually but not always against the clock on very short and compact temporary courses Rather than being a high speed test car handling manoeuvres can be tested such as precision drifting donuts handbrake turns reversing and so on Other Other disciplines of automobile sport include demolition derby monster truck events rock crawling tractor pulling land speed record attempts trials Non automobile forms of motorsport Motorcycle racing Freestyle motocross Motorcycle trials Motorboat racing Air racing Drone racing Hovercraft racing

    "Dakar Rally": {
        "text": "The Dakar Rally or simply The Dakar French Le Rallye Dakar ou Le Dakar formerly known as the Paris Dakar Rally French Le Rallye Paris Dakar is an annual rally raid organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation Most events since the inception in 1978 were staged from Paris France to Dakar Senegal Security threats in Mauritania led to the cancellation of the 2008 rally and events from 2009 to 2019 were held in South America Since 2020 the rally has been held in Saudi Arabia The event is open to amateur and professional entries professionals typically making up about eighty percent of the participants The rally is an off road endurance event The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying and the vehicles used are typically true off road vehicles and motorcycles rather than modified on road vehicles Most of the competitive special sections are off road crossing dunes mud camel grass rocks and erg among others The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to 800 900 kilometres 500 560 mi per day The rough terrain driver fatigue and lack of skill usually results in accidents and serious injuries History Predecessors The Mediterranean Rally also known als Algiers Cape Town Rally was a trans Africa rally ran in 5 editions between 1951 and 1961 It evolved from the original mixed road and off road rally to a fully off road endurance event during the pioneer years of trans Africa rallies Crossing the Sahara The race originated in December 1977 a year after Thierry Sabine got lost in the T n r desert whilst competing in the 1975 Cote Cote Abidjan Nice rally and decided that the desert would be a good location for a regular rally on the lines of the 1974 London Sahara Munich World Cup Rally the first automobile race to cross the Sahara Desert twice In 1971 ex Cream drummer Ginger Baker used the unproven Range Rover to drive from Algeria to Lagos Nigeria to set up a recording studio and jam with Fela Kuti Predating the Paris Dakar Rally the subsequent documentary is replete with such terrain and documents the vehicle s endurance Early growth 182 vehicles took the start of the inaugural rally in Paris with 74 surviving the 10 000 kilometre 6 200 mi trip to the Senegalese capital of Dakar Cyril Neveu was the event s first winner riding a Yamaha motorcycle The event rapidly grew in popularity with 216 vehicles taking the start in 1980 and 291 in 1981 The privateer spirit of early racers tackling the event with limited resources encouraged such entrants as Thierry de Montcorg in a Rolls Royce and Formula 1 driver Jacky Ickx with actor Claude Brasseur in a Citro n CX in the 1981 race won by two time winner Hubert Auriol In 1982 there were 382 racers more than double the number that took the start in 1979 Neveu won the event for a third time this time riding a Honda motorcycle while victory in the car class went to the Marreau brothers driving a privately entered Renault 20 Auriol captured his second bikes class victory in 1983 the first year that Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi competed in the rally beginning an association that would last until 2009 At the behest of 1983 car class winner Jacky Ickx Porsche entered the Dakar in 1984 with the total number of entries now at 427 The German marque won the event at their first attempt courtesy of Ren Metge who had previously won in the car category in 1981 whilst Ickx finished sixth Gaston Rahier meanwhile continued BMW s success in the motorcycle category with back to back wins in 1984 and 1985 the year of Mitsubishi s first victory of 12 in the car category Patrick Zaniroli taking the spoils The 1986 event won by Metge and Neveu was marred by the death of event founder Sabine in a helicopter crash his father Gilbert taking over organisation of the rally Peugeot and Citro n domination The 1987 rally marked the start of an era of increased official factory participation in the car category as French manufacturer Peugeot arrived and won the event with former World Rally champion Ari Vatanen The 1987 event was also notable for a ferocious head to head duel between Neveu and Auriol in the motorcycle category the former taking his fifth victory after Auriol was forced to drop out of the rally after breaking both ankles in a fall The 1988 event reached its zenith in terms of entry numbers with 603 starters Vatanen s title defence was derailed when his Peugeot was stolen from the service area at Bamako Though it was later found Vatanen was subsequently disqualified from the event victory instead going to compatriot and teammate Juha Kankkunen Peugeot and Vatanen returned to winning ways in 1989 and 1990 the latter marking Peugeot s final year of rally competition before switching to the World Sportscar Championship Sister brand Citro n took Peugeot s place Vatanen taking a third consecutive victory in 1991 The 1991 event also saw St phane Peterhansel take his first title in the motorcycle category with Yamaha marking the beginning of an era of domination by the Frenchman For the 1992 event the finish line moved to Cape Town South Africa in a bid to combat a declining number of competitors where GPS technology was used for the first time Auriol became the first person to win in multiple classes after taking Mitsubishi s second victory in the car class while Peterhansel successfully defended his motorcycle category title The 1993 rally entry list slumped to 153 competitors around half of the preceding year s figure and around a quarter of that of 1988 The event was the last to be organised by Gilbert Sabine and the Amaury Sport Organisation took over the following year With the finish line now back in its traditional location of Dakar Bruno Saby won a third title for Mitsubishi and Peterhansel took a third straight success in the motorcycle category The 1994 event returned to Paris after reaching Dakar resulting in a particularly grueling event Pierre Lartigue took Citro n s second win in acrimonious circumstances as Mitsubishi s leading drivers were forced to withdraw from exhaustion after traversing some particularly demanding sand dunes in the Mauritanian desert that the Citro n crews had opted to skip Peterhansel s did not compete due to a disagreement between Yamaha and the race organizers over the regulations Edi Orioli claimed a third title in the bikes category The 1995 and 1996 events begin in the Spanish city of Granada with Lartigue racking up wins for Citro n in both years Peterhansel returned to take a fourth bikes category win in 1995 but lost to Orioli in 1996 because of refuelling problems Mitsubishi in the ascendancy The 1997 rally ran exclusively in Africa for the first time with the route running from Dakar to Agadez Niger and back to Dakar Citro n s withdrawal due to a rule change paved the way for Mitsubishi to take a fourth victory Japan s Kenjiro Shinozuka became the first non European to win the event Peterhansel equalled Neveu s record of five motorcycle category wins in 1997 before going one better in 1998 when the event returned to its traditional Paris Dakar route 1998 Dakar veteran Jean Pierre Fontenay posted another win for Mitsubishi in the car class 1999 started in Granada and a maiden success for erstwhile Formula One and sports car driver Jean Louis Schlesser who had been constructing his own buggies since 1992 With the help of Renault backing Schlesser overcame the works Mitsubishi and Nissan crews to win whilst Peterhansel s decision to switch to the car category allowed Richard Sainct to take BMW s first title in the bikes category since 1985 Schlesser and Sainct both successfully defended their titles in 2000 traversing the route from Dakar to the Egyptian capital of Cairo 2001 was the final time that the rally used the familiar Paris Dakar route and was notable for Mitsubishi s Jutta Kleinschmidt as she was the first woman to win the rally albeit only after Schlesser was penalised one hour for unsportsmanlike conduct Fabrizio Meoni took the first Dakar win for Austrian manufacturer KTM beginning a winning streak that lasted through 2019 The 2002 began in the French town of Arras and long time Dakar participant Hiroshi Masuoka won the event for Mitsubishi Masouka had led for much of the previous year s rally The 2003 rally featured an unorthodox route from Marseille to Sharm El Sheikh Masuoka defend his title after teammate and long time leader Peterhansel was plagued by mechanical problems in the penultimate stage Sainct meanwhile took honours in the motorcycle category the third title for both him and KTM Mid 2000s By 2004 the entry list had increased to 595 up from 358 in 2001 with a record 688 competitors starting in 2005 Alongside Mitsubishi and Nissan Volkswagen now boasted a full factory effort while Schlesser s Ford powered buggies and BMWs of the German X raid team proved thorns in the side of the big budget works teams The 2004 route was from Clermont Ferrand to Dakar and was the year Peterhansel emulated Hubert Auriol s feat of winning the rally on both two wheels and four The Frenchman defended his title in 2005 when the rally began for the first time in Barcelona In the bikes category KTM continued their success with Nani Roma in 2004 who switched to the car category the following year and Cyril Despres in 2005 The 2006 event moved to Lisbon Nissan pulled out having failed to provide effective opposition to Mitsubishi who took a sixth consecutive victory this time with former skiing champion Luc Alphand after Peterhansel committed a series of errors late in the rally Peterhansel made amends in 2007 however taking his third title in the car category for Mitsubishi after a close contest with Alphand after the increasingly competitive Volkswagens retired with mechanical problems In what would be the final African event of the Dakar Despres took his second title in the bikes category having conceded victory in 2006 to Marc Coma after suffering an injury 2008 Dakar Rally cancelled The 2008 event due to start in Lisbon was cancelled on 4 January 2008 amid fears of attacks in Mauritania following the 2007 killing of four French tourists Chile and Argentina offered to host subsequent events which were later accepted by the ASO for the 2009 event The ASO also decided to establish the Dakar Series competition whose first event was the 2008 Central Europe Rally held in Hungary and Romania which acted as a replacement for the cancelled 2008 edition of the Dakar South America The 2009 event the first held in South America with a respectable 501 competitors saw Volkswagen take its first win in the Dakar as a works entrant courtesy of Giniel de Villiers Initially teammate and former WRC champion Carlos Sainz led the race comfortably until crashing out but went on to win the event in 2010 After a poor showing in 2009 Mitsubishi withdrew from the competition and left Volkswagen as the sole works entrant The German marque won the race for a third time in 2011 this time with Nasser Al Attiyah before they withdrew to focus on their upcoming WRC entry and leaving the Dakar with no factory participants in the car class In the bikes Despres and Coma stretched KTM s incredible unbroken run of success Both tied on three victories apiece after Coma s third win in 2011 In the 2012 rally the X raid team came to the fore now using Minis in lieu of BMWs Peterhansel had joined the team in 2010 after Mitsubishi s departure but had been unable to challenge the Volkswagen drivers Following Volkswagen s withdrawal Peterhansel was able to secure his fourth win in the car category and his tenth in total his main opposition coming from within his own team Peterhansel successfully defended his title in 2013 as the Damen Jefferies buggies of Sainz and Al Attiyah failed to last the distance Despres also racked up a further two wins for KTM in the bikes class in 2012 and 2013 bringing his tally to five aided by Coma s absence due to injury in the latter year Coma struck back on his return to the Dakar in 2014 taking a comfortable fourth title and a 13th in succession for KTM whilst Nani Roma emulated Auriol and Peterhansel by taking his maiden title in the cars class a decade on from his victory on two wheels albeit only after team orders by X raid slowed down Peterhansel Peugeot returned for the 2015 event with an all new diesel powered two wheel drive contender but failed to make an impact as X raid s Minis once more dominated Al Attiyah won the event in his second year for the team while Coma racked up a fifth title in the bikes after the defection of long time rival Despres to the car class and Peugeot Peugeot did however see success in 2016 with Peterhansel behind the wheel racking up his 6th win in the car category and again in 2017 and 2018 until Peugeot decide to officially leave the competition In 2019 Toyota won for the first time with Nasser Al Attiyah in his third victory with three different manufacturers The bike category saw the KTM works team rider Australian Toby Price take his first Dakar victory winning his second title in 2019 Sam Sunderland and Matthias Walkner won the 2017 and 2018 edition also for the team from Mattighofen 18 overall victories as in 2019 Saudi Arabia The rally has been held in Saudi Arabia since 2020 Since 2022 the rally has been the season opening round of the World Rally Raid Championship jointly sanctioned by the F d ration Internationale de l Automobile and F d ration Internationale de Motocyclisme The 2023 event ran from 31 December 2022 to 15 January 2023 Vehicles and classes The five competitive groups in the Dakar are the motorcycles quads the cars class which ranges from buggies to small SUVs UTVs and the trucks class Many vehicle manufacturers use the rally s harsh environment as both a testing ground and an opportunity to show off their vehicles durability even though most vehicles are heavily modified from their production specification or purpose built Motorbikes For the 2005 rally regulations introduced a limit of 450cc for twin cylinder motorbikes Single cylinder motorbikes were still open class with no capacity limit As of 2011 the engine displacement limit for all motorbikes competing in the Dakar Rally is 450cc Engines may be either single or twin cylinder Riders are divided into two groups RallyGP and Rally2 A subcategory is the Original by Motul category formerly named Malle Moto due to the only piece of luggage competitors were allowed to take with them was a malle a French term for box or trunk which refers to motorbikes and quads competing without any kind assistance The organization provides assistance for this category with 4 people dedicated to the transportation of the competitors malle or boxes between bivouac sites plus any additional equipment or belongings This includes 1 trunk 1 set of wheels 1 sleeping tent 1 travel bag 1 set of tyres free use of the generators compressors and tool boxes and easy access to race information Since these competitors are not allowed to receive any outside support each rider must service their own vehicle It is often called the category for the toughest of the tough and one for the Dakar purists KTM has dominated the motorcycle class in recent years although Honda Yamaha Sherco Husqvarna and Gas Gas also compete currently BMW and Cagiva have also enjoyed success in the past Quads Prior to 2009 Quads were a subdivision of the motorbike category but they were granted their own separate classification in 2009 and are designated Group 3 in the current regulations They are divided into two subgroups Group 3 1 which features two wheel drive quads with a single cylinder engine with a maximum displacement of 750cc and Group 3 2 which permits four wheel drive quads with a maximum engine displacement of 900cc in either single or twin cylinder layout Yamaha are unbeaten in the Quad category since 2009 with their main current opposition coming courtesy of Honda and Can Am Cars The car class is made up of vehicles weighing less than 3 500 kg 7 716 lb which are subdivided into several categories The T1 Group is made up of Improved Cross Country Vehicles subdivided according to engine type petrol or diesel and drive type two wheel or four wheel drive The T2 Group is made up of Cross Country Series Production Vehicles which are subdivided into petrol and diesel categories while the T3 Group is for Light Vehicles There is also an Open category catering for vehicles conforming to SCORE regulations Mini have been the most successful marque in the car category in recent years thanks to the efforts of the non factory X raid team with limited involvement currently coming from Toyota Ford and Haval Several constructors also produce bespoke buggies for the event most notably SMG and Damen Jefferies Mitsubishi is historically the most successful manufacturer in the car class with Volkswagen Citro n Peugeot and Porsche having all tasted success in the past with factory teams Jean Louis Schlesser has also won the event twice with his Renault supported buggies Factory teams from Nissan and SEAT have also won stages as has BMW courtesy of the X raid team Trucks The Truck class Group T4 first run as a separate category in 1980 is made up of vehicles weighing more than 3 500 kg 7 716 lb Trucks participating in the competition are subdivided into Series Production trucks T4 1 and Modified trucks T4 2 whilst Group T4 3 formerly known as T5 trucks are rally support trucks meaning they travel from bivouac to bivouac to support the competition vehicles These were introduced to the rally in 1998 The truck event was not run in 1989 after it was decided the vehicles by this stage with twin engines generating in excess of 1000 horsepower were too dangerous following the death of a DAF crew member in an accident during the 1988 rally Kamaz has dominated the truck category since the turn of the century although it has come under increasing pressure from rivals such as Iveco MAN Renault and Tatra which enjoyed much success in the 1990s Hino DAF Perlini and Mercedes Benz have also been among the winners in the past In the 21st century Kamaz almost always won the truck class winning fourteen out of eighteen times UTVs The utility task vehicle UTV category was introduced in 2017 Before this UTVs ran under the car category as the T3 class The class rapidly gained in popularity and in 2021 the class was further subdivided into separate T3 light prototypes category and T4 SSVs which are based on production vehicles Classics A new Dakar Classic class was introduced in 2021 for cars and trucks manufactured before 2000 or new vehicles built to original pre 2000 specification These vehicles share the same bivouac and the organization but run in a parallel yet different route suitable for historic vehicles The scoreboard is not based on fastest time but rather on regularity rally point scoring system The class feature a reduced entry fee yet the same rules and fees apply

advised by the French government to cancel the race which had been due to begin on 5 January 2008 from Lisbon They said direct threats had also been made against the event by al Qaeda related

subject to criticism from several sources generally focusing on the race s impact on the inhabitants of the African countries through which it passed Some African residents along the race s course in previous years have said they saw limited benefits from the race that race participants spent little money on the goods and services local residents can offer The racers produced substantial amounts of dust along the course and were blamed for hitting and killing livestock in addition to occasionally injuring or killing people After the 1988 race when three Africans were killed in collisions with vehicles involved in the race PANA a Dakar based news agency wrote that the deaths were insignificant for the race s organisers The Vatican City newspaper L Osservatore Romano called the race a vulgar display of power and wealth in places where men continue to die from hunger and thirst During a 2002 protest at the race s start in Arras France a Green Party of France statement described the race as colonialism that needs to be eradicated The rally was criticised before 2000 for crossing through the disputed territory of Western Sahara which has been occupied by Morocco since 1975 without the approval of the Polisario Front independence movement which considers itself the representative of the indigenous Sahrawi people After the race officials gained formal permission from the Polisario from 2000 onwards this ceased to be an issue The environmental impact of the race has been another area of criticism This criticism of the race is the topic of the song 500 connards sur la ligne de d part 500 Arseholes at the Starting Line on the 1991 album Marchand de cailloux by French singer Renaud In 2014 the Dakar rally was criticized for damage done to archaeological sites in Chile The move

rights organizations against the choice of host country for the 2020 season the Dakar Rally was organized in Saudi Arabia for another consecutive year While it was being denounced as an attempt of sportswashing by Saudi Arabia the organizers defended the decision See also Africa Eco Race rally raid launched in 2009 in response to the Dakar s move to South America Budapest Bamako Desert Rally

use was to make hunting locations more accessible David Johnson and several employees created the prototype in 1954 while Edgar was on a business trip Edgar returned to Roseau to discover the snow machine and was furious the employees had used their time and company resources on the machine This first machine used a grain silo conveyor belt as a track a Briggs and Stratton motor and an old Chevy bumper for skis Edgar was skeptical of its value and the No 1 sled was soon sold to Roseau lumberyard owner Silver Pete H F Peterson for 465 in order to meet company payroll However the
