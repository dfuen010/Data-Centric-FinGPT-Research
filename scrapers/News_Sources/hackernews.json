{"by":"nickpsecurity","id":39911583,"parent":39908579.0,"text":"My concerns about this were theft, mistakes, cost to operate, and opportunity costs.<p>Theft is an obvious one. It happens in self checkouts in many ways. We had people come into our store to just leave with baskets of stuff, load their pockets, take stuff from one box to put in a cheaper one they bought, or even put raw eggs and meat in their pockets. That was with a ton of workers in the store looking out for thieves.<p>Errors could result in us being charged for what we didn\u2019t buy. The amount could be lower or higher. Some people go through their whole receipt double checking it. Many of us just watch it as they ring it up, deal with it there, and stop thinking about it once we leave. Could this impact peace of mind?<p>Cost to operate seemed like it might be high. Aldi and Costco show a traditional self-checkout can be cheap to operate on top of serving high-end customers. (See theft&#x2F;shrink, though.) I figured the machine learning alternatives would cost thousands to tens of thousands a unit for combinations of cameras, servers, and licensed software. They\u2019d also need to be monitored and&#x2F;or trained by humans which this article just confirmed.<p>I was also worried about fraud. My company bought a solution that monitored customers with infrared cameras, monitored checkouts, and predicted how many registers we needed. That was a <i>terrible<\/i> system that hurt us more than it helped. We were required to act like it worked to please those who spent hundreds of millions on it. I wondered how often such dishonest referrals helped the supplier sell them. Made me skeptical about more AI.<p>Finally, the human touch that comes with good cashiers increases customer satisfaction. Our customers often looked forward to seeing us. For some, we were the only or best social contact they got that week. Others liked getting out of the house for a long period of time. Sometimes they\u2019d have us push products and services which, normally a negative for all, is largely how they drove up credit card use and feedback on the customer tracker.<p>For those reasons, I advised against using AI for anything other than helping employees do their jobs more easily. If for that, that it would be a support tool instead of trying to replace skilled, decision makers. Then, simply invest those millions to hundreds of millions in the employees.

According to a 1946 edict of Buckingham Palace (whose text does not appear to be publicly available, although there are public documents referencing it), the procedure is (a) request is approved by Prime Minister (for national orgs) or state Premier (for state-based orgs)\u2013in their sole individual discretion, (b) PM&#x2F;Premier advises GG&#x2F;Governor to submit request to Buckingham Palace, (c) the King&#x2F;Queen signs it and returns it. Although theoretically either the GG&#x2F;Governor or the monarch could veto the request, it is almost inconceivable they ever would. I think, theoretically, Buckingham Palace could delegate the power to sign them to GG&#x2F;Governor, but they likely worry that not having the monarch sign it personally would deprive it of its magical properties. Also, in 1983, the federal government adopted a policy that the PM would no longer consider applications for the title &quot;Royal&quot; from national orgs, so now only state-based ones can get it. Any future PM could decide to change that, but in over 40 years nobody has. Even Tony Abbott, who was such a devout monarchist that he had to (briefly) resurrect knighthoods, couldn&#x27;t be bothered.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re going to cast a magic spell you&#x27;ve gotta get it right.<p>There is a notice on the Privy Council&#x27;s website saying their list is not exhaustive, and please contact them to report any omissions.

Still anecdotal, but our family ended up doing the first part of your sentence - that is, we abandoned our existing gas car.  However, it was certainly not a lot more money - in fact part of the equation was that it was slightly cheaper to get the EV, exactly because it was not a super luxurious super long range $100k vehicle.  There turned out to be a bonus benefit of 1 year of free charging at EVgo chargers, which we didn&#x27;t count on but is nice.<p>Our main reason for this was that the gas car we replaced was requiring a lot of repairs and we were hoping to minimize the time we spend at repair shops.  Hopefully the EV will require even less time than an IC vehicle due to no fluid changes.<p>One other unexpected change we encountered is that due to charging at home, we spend less total time fueling up the car, i.e. no more gas station visits.  The time we occasionally use the free EVGO charger is at a department store so it&#x27;s a side effect of going shopping instead of a single-purpose refueling trip.","time":1712096072,"type":"comment","descendants":null,"score":null,"title":null,"url":null,"dead":null,"kids":null,"deleted":null}
