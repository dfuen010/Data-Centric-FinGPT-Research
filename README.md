# Data-Centric-FinGPT-Research #

Web Scraping Efforts
- Working on web scrapers from different open financial data sources (SEC for example) to use in our data collection for FinGPT's training data
- Looking for open-source data sources that have the appropriate OSI-approved licenses for our use in data-scraping to use in training data for FinGPT
- Team is working on how to best scrape these approved data sources we have found so far in a readable format in order to conduct further data cleaning on these datasets

Fin NLP Efforts
- Testing different LLMs (Llama, ChatGPT) and seeing their accuracy in evaluating task relating to finance
- Using FinNLP repo from AI4Finance to assist us in updating/remodeling it to better filter our data sources for only financially relevant data
- Still doing research into how to leverage FinNLP in our data-scraping process to filter out/pick out relevant finanical information from our data sources
