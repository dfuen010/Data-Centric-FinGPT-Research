get open access datasets -> clean data to only obtain finanical related info -> repeat -> combine data into training sets -> maybe train finGPT on this data 


We found some datasets that are open-access
next we need to clean the datasets and filter out anything that is not related to financial topics
(cleanning -> maybe NLP processor to pick out finanical terms/text blocks)
If we run out of datasets, research more (Verifing that they are open-access)
Create table like BloombergGPT
- Look at the table and generate the same stats for our datasets
- Tokenization (breaking down texts into smaller topics/concepts, look this up if confused)
